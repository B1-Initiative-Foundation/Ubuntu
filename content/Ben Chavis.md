## Personal Life

In 1971, Chavis was sent by the United Church of Christ to Wilmington, North Carolina to help desegregate the public school system. He was later falsely convicted and imprisoned as part of the Wilmington Ten, a group declared political prisoners by Amnesty International.[2][3] 

After being released from prison in 1980, Chavis earned a Master's of Divinity from Duke University and a Doctorate of Ministry from Howard University.[2] In 1985, he was named executive director of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice.[3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
During his time as NAACP executive director, Chavis was involved in a controversy over a secret $332,400 severance deal he made with an NAACP employee without the board's knowledge, which ultimately led to his dismissal in 1994.[1] There are also reports of his involvement with the Nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan, though the details of this relationship are unclear.[3]
