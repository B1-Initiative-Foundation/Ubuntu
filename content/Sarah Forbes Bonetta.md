Here is a concise biography of Sarah Forbes Bonetta based on the search results:

## Personal Life
Sarah Forbes Bonetta was born "Aina" around 1843 in what is now Nigeria. She was orphaned during the Okeadon war at age 5 and taken captive by King Gezo of the Dahomey kingdom. In 1850, she was "gifted" by King Gezo to Captain Frederick Forbes of the Royal Navy as a diplomatic gesture. Forbes renamed her Sarah Forbes Bonetta after his ship, the HMS Bonetta. [1][2][4]

After arriving in England, Sarah was presented to Queen Victoria, who took a personal interest in her and provided for her education and upbringing. She was frequently invited to visit the royal family at Windsor Castle and other residences. [1][4][5]

In 1862, at age 19, Sarah married James Pinson Labulo Davies, a Sierra Leonean merchant and naval officer. They had three children together - Victoria, Arthur, and Stella. [2]

## Career
Sarah was educated at the Church Missionary Society school in Freetown, Sierra Leone, with the intention that she would become a missionary. However, she returned to England after four years. Queen Victoria then placed her with the Schoen family, former missionaries in Africa, who lived in Gillingham, Kent. Sarah lived with them for six years before moving to Brighton, where Victoria had arranged for a Miss Welsh to oversee her introduction into British society. [1][4]

## Achievements
Sarah was described as highly intelligent and accomplished, with great talent for music. She was viewed as a symbol who challenged racist beliefs about the intellectual inferiority of Africans. [1][3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
While Sarah enjoyed a privileged position in British royalty, she was also subject to intense scrutiny and viewed by some as the subject of a "civilizing mission." Her own voice and perspective is largely absent from the historical record. [3]
