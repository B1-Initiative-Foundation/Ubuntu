John Hanson was an American Founding Father, merchant, and politician from [[Maryland]] during the Revolutionary Era. In 1779, he was elected as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] after serving in various roles for the Patriot cause in [[Maryland]]. Hanson signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] in 1781 after [[Maryland]] joined the other states in ratifying them. In November 1781, he was elected as the first President of the Confederation Congress (sometimes styled *President of the United States in Congress Assembled*) following ratification of the articles. [3][4]

Hanson was born into a wealthy and prominent family on a plantation called "Mulberry Grove" in [[Port Tobacco]], [[Maryland]]. He served in a variety of political offices, including the [[Maryland General Assembly]]. After the American Revolution, Hanson played a key role in helping to resolve the western lands issue, which facilitated the ratification of the [[Articles of Confederation]]. [3][4]

As "President" under the [[Articles of Confederation]], Hanson was responsible for initiating several important programs, including establishing the first consular service, initiating a post office department, chartering a national bank, and adopting a uniform system of coinage. He also signed all laws, regulations, official papers, and letters during his tenure. [3]

Hanson died on November 15, 1783, at the age of 68. He is honored with the naming of U.S. Route 50 between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Annapolis]] as the "John Hanson Highway", and there are middle schools named after him in [[Oxon Hill]], [[Maryland]] and [[Waldorf]], [[Maryland]]. [4]

John Hanson was a Liberian senator during the mid-19th century, not the John Hanson who was a Founding Father and the first President of the United States under the Articles of Confederation.[1][5]

The John Hanson who served as a Liberian senator was born into slavery in Baltimore, Maryland around 1791. He purchased his freedom and emigrated to Liberia in 1827 through the American Colonization Society. Hanson was elected as a senator of the newly established Colonial Council in Liberia in December 1840, representing Grand Bassa County. He served several terms in the Liberian Senate and was known as a "faithful and patriotic servant" of the young nation. Hanson died in Liberia in 1860 at the age of 69.[5]

The other John Hanson, who is often confused with the Liberian senator, was an American Founding Father, merchant, and politician from Maryland during the Revolutionary Era. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1779 and was elected as the first President of the Confederation Congress in 1781, before the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Hanson played a key role in helping to resolve the western lands issue and facilitate the ratification of the Articles of Confederation.[2][3][4]
