James Hood was a pioneering African American civil rights activist who, along with Vivian Malone, became the first black students to successfully enroll at the University of Alabama in 1963[1][2]. Despite facing intense opposition and threats, Hood and Malone's enrollment helped integrate the university and paved the way for greater racial equality in Alabama[2][4].

Hood was born in Gadsden, Alabama and was a standout athlete and student leader in high school[1]. He won a scholarship to study at Clark College in Atlanta, where he became active in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference led by Martin Luther King Jr. [1]. Persuaded by civil rights leaders, Hood applied to the University of Alabama, writing "Negro, American Negro" on his application[1].

On June 11, 1963, Hood and Malone enrolled at the University of Alabama, defying Governor George Wallace's attempt to block their admission[1][4]. Though he initially withdrew from the university a few months later, Hood's courageous actions that day helped change Alabama and the South forever[2]. He later earned a doctorate from the University of Alabama in 1997 and worked as a police administrator in Wisconsin[1].

Despite facing harassment and threats, including a dead black cat mailed to him, Hood remained committed to civil rights and racial equality throughout his life[1]. He expressed dislike for confrontational tactics by some civil rights leaders, believing that "civil rights are not rights for black people, but rights for all people"[1]. Hood passed away in 2013 at the age of 70[1].

James Hood was one of the first African Americans to enroll at the University of Alabama in 1963, in an event that became known as the "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door".[3]
