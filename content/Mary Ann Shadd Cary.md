## Personal Life
Mary Ann Shadd Cary was born in 1823 in Wilmington, Delaware to Abraham Shadd and Harriet Burton Parnell, a free African American family dedicated to the abolitionist movement. [1][2][4] When she was 10 years old, Shadd Cary moved with her family to the free state of Pennsylvania, where she attended school and became a teacher. [4] The Shadd family actively helped freedom seekers (people who escaped slavery) through the Underground Railroad. [4] After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, which required Northern states to cooperate in sending fugitive slaves back into bondage, the Shadd family emigrated to Canada. [4] In Canada, Shadd Cary married Thomas F. Cary in 1856 and they had two children, though her husband died a few years later. [2]

## Career

In 1852, she published a pamphlet called "A Plea for Emigration" that encouraged other African Americans to emigrate to Canada to escape slavery and racism in the United States. [3][5] In 1853, she became the first Black woman to publish a newspaper, called "The Provincial Freeman", which provided the perspective of Black Canadian emigrants and anti-slavery activists. [3][5] 

During the Civil War, Shadd Cary returned to the United States and worked as a recruiting officer for the Union Army, encouraging African Americans to join the fight against the Confederacy and slavery. [2][4] After the war, she taught in public schools in Washington, D.C. for 15 years. [4] In 1883, at the age of 60, Shadd Cary became one of the first Black women to earn a law degree, graduating from Howard University School of Law. [2][4][5]
