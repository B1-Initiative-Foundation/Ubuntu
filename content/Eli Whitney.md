Eli Whitney was an American inventor, widely known for inventing the cotton gin in 1793, one of the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution that shaped the economy of the Antebellum South.[2][3] Whitney's invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States and prolonged the institution.[2][3] Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost much of his profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin.[2][3] Thereafter, he turned his attention to securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States.[2][3] He continued making arms and inventing until his death in 1825.[2][3]

Eli Whitney was an American inventor best known for inventing the cotton gin in 1793, which was a key invention of the Industrial Revolution that had a major impact on the economy of the Antebellum South. [1]

## Personal Life
Whitney was born on December 8, 1765 in Westborough, Massachusetts to Eli Whitney Sr., a prosperous farmer, and his wife Elizabeth Fay. [1] After his mother's death in 1777 when he was 11 years old, Whitney worked as a farm laborer and school teacher to save money for college. [1] He prepared for Yale at Leicester Academy and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1792. [1]

## Career
After graduating from Yale, Whitney initially planned to study law but instead accepted an offer to go to Georgia as a private tutor. [1] While in Georgia, he was convinced to visit a plantation owned by the widow of Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, where he was asked to invent a machine to efficiently separate cotton fibers from their seeds. [1] This led to his invention of the cotton gin in 1793, which revolutionized cotton production and strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States. [1] 

Despite the significant impact of his invention, Whitney lost much of his profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin. [1] He later turned his attention to securing government contracts for the manufacture of muskets and continued inventing until his death in 1825. [1]

## Achievements
Whitney's invention of the cotton gin was a key innovation of the Industrial Revolution that had a major economic impact, though it also prolonged the institution of slavery in the United States. [1] He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his work. [4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
While the cotton gin greatly increased cotton production, it also strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the Antebellum South. [1] Whitney's invention made upland short cotton a profitable crop, which led to a massive expansion of cotton cultivation and a corresponding increase in the demand for slave labor. [1]
