Autherine Lucy was the first African-American student to attend the [[University of Alabama]] in 1956. Despite facing intense opposition and harassment, she persisted in her efforts to desegregate the university. Though initially expelled, she later returned to the university and earned a master's degree in 1992. Lucy's courageous actions helped pave the way for the integration of higher education in the United States. [1][2][3]

Autherine Lucy was a pioneering African American civil rights activist who became the first Black student to attend the University of Alabama in 1956. 

## Personal Life
Autherine Juanita Lucy was born on October 5, 1929 in Shiloh, Alabama as the youngest of ten children to sharecroppers Minnie Maud Hosea and Milton Cornelius Lucy.[1][2] She attended public school in Shiloh through 10th grade and graduated from Linden Academy in 1947.[1][2] Lucy then went on to attend Selma University and later Miles College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1952.[1][2]

## Career
In 1952, Lucy and her friend Pollie Anne Myers applied to the University of Alabama, which was still segregated at the time.[1][2][3] After initially being accepted, the university later rescinded their admission when they discovered the women were Black.[1][2][3] With the support of the NAACP and lawyers Thurgood Marshall and Arthur Shores, Lucy fought the university's decision in court.[1][2][3] In 1956, after a years-long legal battle, Lucy became the first Black student to enroll at the University of Alabama.[1][2][3] However, she was soon expelled after facing a violent mob of white students and being suspended by the university for her own safety.[1][2][3] Despite this setback, Lucy remained an active participant in the civil rights movement, giving speeches across the country.[4] She went on to teach elementary and high school in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[4]

## Achievements
In 1988, the University of Alabama officially annulled Lucy's expulsion, allowing her to re-enroll and earn a master's degree in elementary education in 1992, which she received alongside her daughter Grazia.[4] In 2019, the university awarded Lucy an honorary doctorate, and in 2022 they renamed a building on campus "Autherine Lucy Hall" in her honor.[4] The university also established a $25,000 endowed scholarship in her name.[3]
