## Career
During his time at the Naval Academy, Conyers faced significant racial harassment and abuse from his white classmates. After enduring a year of torment, including an incident where his classmates tried to drown him, Conyers resigned from the academy in 1873. [1] 

After leaving the Naval Academy, Conyers returned to Charleston and became a ship caulker. He died in 1935, 14 years before Wesley Brown became the first Black graduate of the Naval Academy in 1949. [1]
