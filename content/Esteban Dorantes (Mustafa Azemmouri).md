Esteban Dorantes was an enslaved Moroccan explorer who was the first non-native person to visit the southern reaches of the Colorado Plateau in what is now Arizona and New Mexico[1][2]. He was part of the ill-fated Narváez expedition in 1528, where he and three other survivors - Andrés Dorantes, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, and Alonso del Castillo Maldonado - wandered across Texas and northern Mexico for several years[2][3]. During this time, Esteban gained a reputation as an adept interpreter and communicator, often making first contact with the indigenous tribes they encountered[3]. 

Esteban's explorations and experiences were later used to spark excitement about the lands north of Mexico, leading to the Coronado Expedition in 1540-1542, in which Esteban participated as a scout and guide[1][2]. However, his contributions were often marginalized in the accounts written by the European survivors, as he was an enslaved man with no formal status[3]. Nonetheless, Esteban is considered an important figure as one of the earliest African-American explorers of the American South[3].

Esteban Dorantes, also known as Estevanico or Esteban the Moor, was the first person of African descent to explore North America. Here is a summary of his life and accomplishments:

## Personal Life
Esteban Dorantes was born around 1513 in Azemmour, Morocco.[2] As a young man, he was sold into slavery in 1522 and purchased by the Spanish nobleman Andrés Dorantes de Carranza.[2][3][5] It is unclear whether he was raised Muslim, but he would have been baptized as a Catholic in order to join the Spanish expeditions.[4]

## Career
Esteban's career as an explorer began in 1528 when he participated in the ill-fated expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez to explore Spanish Florida.[2][4] After numerous challenges, including shipwrecks and enslavement by Native Americans, Esteban escaped captivity in 1534 along with three other survivors.[3] They then embarked on an epic 2,000-mile journey through the American interior, becoming the first Africans and Europeans to enter the American West.[3]

In 1539, Esteban was sent by the Viceroy of New Spain to guide Fray Marcos de Niza's expedition in search of the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola.[2][4] Esteban ventured ahead of the main party but was killed by the inhabitants of the Zuni pueblo of Hawikuh.[2][4]

## Achievements
Esteban's journey, as chronicled by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, provided valuable insights into the peoples, wildlife, and geography of western North America.[4] His role as a guide, interpreter, and diplomat during the expeditions was crucial, and he is considered the first African-American explorer of the American South.[3]

## Controversies, Myths, and Misconceptions
While Esteban's contributions were significant, his role is often marginalized in the accounts written by his European companions, Cabeza de Vaca and Andrés Dorantes.[3] There are also contradictions and omissions in the historical records regarding the details of his journey and the circumstances of his death.[3]

## Bibliography
There are no known books authored by Esteban Dorantes, as he did not leave any written accounts of his own. However, his story has been the subject of several recent works of fiction and non-fiction, such as "The Moor's Account" by Laila Lalami and the poem "Estavanico" by Jeffrey Yang.[5]
