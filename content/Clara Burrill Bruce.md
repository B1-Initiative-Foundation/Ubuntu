Clara Burrill Bruce was a pioneering African American woman who overcame significant barriers to become the first woman and first African American to serve as editor-in-chief of the Boston University Law Review in 1926. [1]

## Personal Life
Bruce was born in 1879 in Washington, D.C. to a middle-class Black family. [1][3] She attended the segregated M Street High School, known for its rigorous curriculum, before going on to Miner Normal School and Howard University. [1] In 1903, she married Roscoe Conkling Bruce, whose father Blanche Bruce was the first African American to serve a full term in the U.S. Senate. [1][3] Together, they had three children - Clara, Roscoe Jr., and Burrill. [3]

## Career
After leaving Radcliffe College without a degree in 1903 to marry, Bruce pursued her longtime ambition of studying law, enrolling at Boston University Law School in 1923. [1] She excelled academically, publishing three articles in the BU Law Review and serving as editor-in-chief, the first woman and first African American to hold that position. [1] Despite these accomplishments, Bruce knew that as a Black woman, she was unlikely to be permitted to practice law in the North at the time. [1] Instead, she used her legal education to benefit the Black community. 

In 1926, Bruce became one of the first three Black women admitted to the Massachusetts Bar. [1] She and her husband later accepted jobs managing the Dunbar Garden Apartments in Harlem, a 500-unit complex built by the Rockefeller family to provide housing for middle-class Black families. [1] After the Rockefellers sold the Dunbar in 1936, the Bruces struggled to find suitable employment in the increasingly segregated city of New York. [1]

## Achievements
Bruce's election as editor-in-chief of the BU Law Review in 1926 was a historic achievement, as she was the first woman and first African American to hold that position. [1] She was also nominated to the New York State Assembly in 1938, though she ultimately decided not to run. [3] Throughout her life, Bruce remained active in politics and continued to publish essays, articles, and poems. [1][3]
