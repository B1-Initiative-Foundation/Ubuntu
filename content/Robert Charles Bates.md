## Personal Life
Robert Charles Bates was born on January 27, 1869, in Columbia, South Carolina. His father was a farmer. Bates took a correspondence course in mechanical drawing, possibly from the Scranton Correspondence School in Pennsylvania.

## Career
Despite not graduating, Bates was appointed as the superintendent of manual training at Claflin University in 1890, determined by the Freedmen's Aid Society and the Southern Education Society. By fall of 1890, Bates was teaching architectural drawing at Claflin, and is believed to be the first Black teacher of architecture at a historically Black university (HBU). Two years later, he published a textbook based on his class lectures, which may be the first architecture book authored by an African American. From 1897 to 1900, Bates taught mechanical drawing at Elmira Reformatory in Upstate New York, and later taught vocational trades at the Jacob Tome Institution for Black juvenile delinquents and orphans in Maryland.
