## Personal Life
Maya Wiley was born on January 2, 1964 in Syracuse, New York and raised in Washington, D.C.[3] Her father was civil rights leader, chemist and academic George Wiley, and her mother Wretha Frances (Whittle) Wiley was white, which inspired Wiley to focus on progressive issues.[3] Tragically, Wiley's father died in 1973 when he fell overboard while sailing with Wiley and her brother.[3] Wiley earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Dartmouth College in 1986 and a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School.[3] She is married to Harlan Mandel, CEO of the Media Development Investment Fund, and they live in Brooklyn with their two daughters.[3]

## Career

From 2014 to 2016, Wiley served as counsel to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, where she became known for coining the term "agents of the city" in an attempt to prevent public disclosure of de Blasio's communications.[3] Wiley also founded and served as president of the Center for Social Inclusion, a national policy strategy organization dedicated to dismantling structural racism.[2]

Wiley has taught at The New School and appeared on MSNBC as a political and legal analyst.[3] In 2016, she was appointed chair of the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), where she led the release of the "hold" on proceedings against Daniel Pantaleo, whose illegal chokehold killed Eric Garner, resulting in Pantaleo's firing.[2]

In 2021, Wiley ran in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, placing third behind Eric Adams and Kathryn Garcia.[3] In March 2022, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights announced Wiley's appointment as its president and CEO, and of its sister group, The Leadership Conference Education Fund, effective May 2.[3]

## Achievements
Wiley has been a leader in the civil rights and economic justice movements, both inside and outside of government.[2] During her time as counsel to Mayor de Blasio, the city saw an expansion of minority/women-owned business enterprises contracts.[2] As chair of the CCRB, Wiley increased case closure rates, transparency, and public outreach to potential victims of police abuse.[2] Wiley has also been recognized as one of the World's 100 Most Influential Leaders in Digital Government by Apolitical.[1]
