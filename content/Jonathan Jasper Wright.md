## Biography

Jonathan Jasper Wright was an African-American lawyer who served as a state senator and judge on the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina during Reconstruction from 1870 to 1877. 

## Personal Life
Wright was born on February 11, 1840, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. When he was about six years old, his parents moved to Montrose, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. He attended the district school during the winter months, working for the neighboring farmers the rest of the year. He saved up a small sum of money and entered Lancasterian University in Ithaca, New York.

## Career
After completing his legal studies, Wright attempted to stand the Pennsylvania bar, but was refused admission due to racial prejudice. In 1865, he was sent by the American Missionary Society to Beaufort, South Carolina, as a teacher and legal advisor for the freed slaves. In 1866, he returned to Pennsylvania and was finally admitted to the bar, becoming the first African American licensed to practice law in the state. 

Wright returned to South Carolina as a legal advisor to General Oliver O. Howard of the Freedmen's Bureau. He was elected as a delegate to the South Carolina Constitutional Convention in 1868 and played a major role in shaping the judiciary provisions of the new state constitution. He was then elected as a state senator from Beaufort County. In 1870, the Republican-controlled state legislature elected him to the South Carolina Supreme Court, making him the first African American to serve on a state's highest court. He served on the court until 1877, when white conservatives regained control of the state government.

## Achievements
Wright's election to the South Carolina Supreme Court in 1870 was a major milestone for African American civil rights, coming just five years after the end of the Civil War. During his tenure, he helped draft the judiciary section of the state constitution, which remains in effect today. [1][2][3][4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
After receiving criticism regarding his opinion in the case Ex Parte Norris, Wright's conduct was investigated, which was likely a pretext for removing him from the court. He submitted his resignation in 1877, as the white conservatives regained control of the state government, marking the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of the Jim Crow era.
