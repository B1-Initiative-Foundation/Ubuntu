Clarence Norris was one of the nine African American teenagers falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in [[Paint Rock]], [[Alabama]] in 1931, in an event that became known as the [[Scottsboro Boys]] case. Norris was sentenced to death three times, but his sentences were eventually commuted to life in prison. After serving 15 years, he was paroled in 1946, but later violated his parole and fled to [[New York City]], where he lived under an assumed name for 30 years. In 1976, at the age of 64, Norris was finally granted a full and unconditional pardon by the state of [[Alabama]], officially exonerating him of the false rape charges. He was the last surviving member of the Scottsboro Boys and died in 1989 at the age of 76.[1][2][3][5]

Here is a concise and accurate response to the question about Clarence Norris and the Scottsboro Boys, based on the provided search results:

Clarence Norris was one of the nine young African American men known as the "Scottsboro Boys" who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a freight train in Alabama in 1931. [3][4][5]

Norris, the son of a former slave, was only 19 years old at the time of his arrest. He was convicted of rape three times and sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison. [3][4][5] 

Norris maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal and fought tirelessly to clear his name. In 1976, 45 years after his arrest, Norris was finally granted a full and unconditional pardon by the state of Alabama based on his innocence. [5]

The Scottsboro case was a major civil rights case that highlighted the systemic racism and injustice faced by African Americans in the Jim Crow-era South. Norris' perseverance in fighting his conviction for decades until he was exonerated is a testament to his strength and the importance of the case. [3][4][5]
