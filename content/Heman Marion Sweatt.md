Heman Marion Sweatt was an African-American civil rights activist who challenged racial segregation in higher education. [1][2][3]

## Personal Life
Sweatt was born on December 11, 1912 in Houston, Texas. He was the fourth of six children born to James Leonard Sweatt and Ella Rose Perry. Sweatt grew up in a relatively desegregated area of Houston, but still experienced racism and Jim Crow laws. [3] In 1930, he graduated from Jack Yates High School and earned a degree from Wiley College in Marshall, Texas in 1934, where he joined Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. [3] In 1940, he married his high school sweetheart, Constantine Mitchell, and they later adopted a daughter. [3][4]

## Career
Sweatt worked as a postal worker in Houston and was the local secretary of the National Alliance of Postal Employees, where he challenged employment discrimination against African-Americans. [1][3] During the early 1940s, he participated in voter-registration drives and raised funds for lawsuits against the white primary. [3] 

## Sweatt v. Painter
In 1946, Sweatt applied for admission to the University of Texas School of Law, but was denied due to racial segregation laws. [1][3][5] With the help of the NAACP, Sweatt filed a lawsuit against the university, known as Sweatt v. Painter. [1][3][5] The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 1950 that the separate law school facilities for African-Americans did not provide equal educational opportunities. [3][5] As a result, Sweatt was admitted to the University of Texas Law School in September 1950. [3][5]

## Later Years
However, the stress and emotional trauma from the long legal battle took a toll on Sweatt's health. [3] He had to withdraw from law school in 1952 due to poor grades and health issues. [3] Sweatt later received a master's degree in Community Organizations from Atlanta University in 1954. [3] He went on to work for the NAACP and the National Urban League for many years, focusing on voter registration and creating programs for southern blacks who migrated north. [3][4] Sweatt died on October 3, 1982 in Atlanta. [3][4]
