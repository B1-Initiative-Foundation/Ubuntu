Edward Jones was the first Black American to graduate from Amherst College in Massachusetts in 1826.[1][3][4] He was born in Charleston, South Carolina and became part of the mulatto elite of that majority African-American city.[3] 

Jones was a prominent missionary and figure in the colony of Sierra Leone.[3][4] He was the first black principal of Fourah Bay College and held the post for 15 years.[3][4] Jones was also the secretary of the Sierra Leone Mission for several years.[4]

Jones was an outstanding scholar, and was highly esteemed by the native clergy and congregations in Sierra Leone as a missionary and role model.[4] He was an intrepid champion of native advancement and frequently challenged European missionary prejudice.[4] However, his last few years in the colony were clouded by failing health and beleaguered relations with the Church Missionary Society.[4]

Jones died in England in 1865.[3]
