Ozie Powell was one of the nine young African American men, known as the "Scottsboro Boys", who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in Alabama in 1931[1][2][3]. Powell was 16 years old at the time of the incident[2].

In 1936, while being transported between prisons, Powell stabbed a prison officer, who then shot Powell in the head in response[1]. Powell survived the gunshot wound but suffered lasting damage[2]. The rape charges against Powell were later dropped, and he pleaded guilty to the assault on the officer, for which he was sentenced to 20 years in prison[3].

The Scottsboro Boys case became a major civil rights issue, highlighting the racial injustice and discrimination faced by African Americans in the Jim Crow-era South[1][2][3]. Despite the Supreme Court rulings in their favor, the Scottsboro Boys faced continued persecution and struggled to reclaim their lives after their ordeal[3].

Based on the search results provided, here is a summary of the key information about Ozie Powell and his involvement in the Scottsboro case:

Ozie Powell was one of the nine African American teenagers, known as the "Scottsboro Boys", who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in Alabama in 1931. [2]

Powell was born in rural Georgia in 1916. His parents separated when he was young, and his mother worked for white people in Atlanta. Powell had limited education, testifying at one of the trials that he had only about 3 months of schooling in his life. [2]

At Haywood Patterson's first trial, Powell testified that he had followed a group of Black boys who were going to throw the white boys off the train, but most of their opposition had jumped off the train by the time he got to the right car. [2]

Powell was arrested along with the other eight African American boys, and it was under his name that an appeal went before the U.S. Supreme Court (Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932)), which ruled that the defendants did not receive adequate defense counsel. [2]

At Haywood Patterson's third trial, Powell's testimony was described as "confused and contradictory" after a tough cross-examination. [2]

Powell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for assaulting a deputy, after the rape charges against him were dropped. He spent years in and out of prison due to parole violations, never fully exonerated. [4]

In 2013, the Alabama legislature cleared the path for posthumous pardons, and the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles granted posthumous pardons to Powell, along with two other Scottsboro Boys. [3]
