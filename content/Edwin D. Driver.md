## Personal Life
Edwin D. Driver was born on January 23, 1925 in Gloucester, Virginia and was raised primarily in Philadelphia.[1] He received his BA from Temple University in 1945 and his MA from the University of Pennsylvania in 1947.[1] Driver married Aloo Jhabvala, a native of Mumbai, India and a sociologist like her husband. Together they had three children, all of whom followed in academic distinction.[1]

## Career
In 1948, at just 23 years old, Edwin D. Driver was hired by the Sociology Department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, becoming the first person of non-European descent to join the faculty.[1] Along with Ruby Pernell of the University of Minnesota, Driver was one of the first two African Americans hired onto the faculty of a state flagship university in the 20th century.[1] 

Driver remained at UMass Amherst for his entire career, earning emeritus status upon his retirement in 1987.[1] During his time at UMass, he helped build the Sociology department, teaching 12 credits per term and filling a heavy schedule of service.[1] His early research included work in the sociology of mental health and criminology, but grew to include demography, urbanization, and comparative sociology.[1] By the mid-1950s, he developed a research program in South Asia, particularly central and south India.[1]

Driver served as a United Nations Senior Advisor to the Iranian government in 1977 and as a consultant to the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the OECD in Paris, and the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health.[1]

## Achievements
Driver was the recipient of three Fulbright awards, which placed him as a visiting lecturer at Nagpur University in 1957-1958 and at Madras.[1] He was also a recipient of a Danforth Fellowship.[1] 

Among Driver's noteworthy publications were "Differential Fertility in Central India" (1963), "The Sociology and Anthropology of Mental Illness: A Reference Guide" (1965), "W. E. B. Du Bois on Sociology and the Black Community" (edited with his colleague Dan S. Green, 1978), and "Social Class in Urban India: Essays on Cognitions and Structures" (edited with wife Aloo E. Driver, 1987).[1]
