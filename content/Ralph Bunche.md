Ralph Bunche was an American political scientist, diplomat, and leading actor in the mid-20th-century decolonization process and US civil rights movement. He received the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for his late 1940s mediation in the Arab-Israeli conflict[2][4][5]. Bunche was the first African American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize and was considered the most celebrated African American of his time both in the US and abroad[2][4][5].

Bunche was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1904 and raised in Los Angeles, California[4][5]. He was a brilliant student, debater, and athlete, graduating as valedictorian from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1927[4][5]. Bunche went on to earn a master's degree and Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University, becoming the first African American to gain a Ph.D. in political science from an American university[4][5].

Bunche had a distinguished academic career, teaching at Howard University and conducting postdoctoral research at Northwestern University[4][5]. He was a recognized authority on race relations and was involved with the National Negro Congress, though he later left the organization after it was taken over by the American Communist Party[5].

During World War II, Bunche joined the staff of the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the CIA[2][5]. After the war, he played a key role in the founding of the United Nations, helping to draft the UN Charter[2][4][5]. Bunche later served as the UN's chief mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950[2][4][5].

Throughout his career, Bunche was a champion of global racial justice and worked tirelessly to make the world a better place[2][4]. He marched with Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement and faced racial discrimination himself, including being denied membership at a tennis club in his own neighborhood[4][5]. Bunche's legacy as a pioneering diplomat and advocate for peace and equality continues to be celebrated today[2][4].
