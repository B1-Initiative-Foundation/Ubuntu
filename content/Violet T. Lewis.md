Violet T. Lewis was an American educator and businesswoman who founded the Lewis College of Business in 1928, which later became the only historically Black college and university (HBCU) in the state of Michigan.[1][2] In 1939, the college relocated to Detroit, where it operated until losing its HBCU accreditation in 2013.[1] In 2021, the college was revived as the Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design, with a focus on fashion and footwear design, as well as other programs.[1][4][5]

Violet T. Lewis was an American businesswoman and educator who founded the Lewis College of Business in 1928, the only historically black college in Michigan. [2]

## Personal Life
Violet T. Lewis was born Violet Temple Harrison on May 27, 1897 in Lima, Ohio. She was the second of six children born to William David Harrison and Eva Brown Harrison. [2][3] Lewis graduated from Lima High School in 1915 and then attended Wilberforce University, a private historically black university in Ohio, graduating in 1917 from the secretarial program. [2][4]

## Career
After graduating, Lewis' first job was as a secretary to the president of Selma University in Alabama. She noticed there were no secretarial classes, so she requested and received permission to start teaching secretarial subjects. [1][4] 

Lewis later moved to Indianapolis, Indiana where she worked as a bookkeeper for the Madam C.J. Walker Company and the Indianapolis Recorder newspaper. During this time, she noticed the lack of Black women employed as secretaries. [4] In 1928, Lewis used a $50 loan to open the Lewis Business College in Indianapolis, the city's first predominantly Black institution of higher education. [4] 

In 1939, Lewis opened a branch of the school in Detroit, Michigan, which became very successful due to the growing automobile industry and need for secretarial skills. She eventually closed the Indianapolis school and focused solely on the Detroit location, steering it from a nine-month stenographic course to an accredited junior college. [2][3][4]

## Achievements
Lewis was the first African American stenographer to work for the Indiana General Assembly in 1930. [4] In 1932, she started her own radio program called "The Negro Melody Hour", making her the first Black female radio announcer in Indiana. [4] 

Lewis co-founded the Gamma Phi Delta sorority in 1943 and received an honorary doctorate from her alma mater, Wilberforce University, posthumously. [2][4] The Detroit location of the Lewis College of Business was officially designated a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) by the U.S. Department of Education in 1987. [4]
