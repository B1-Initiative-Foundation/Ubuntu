Robert Nathaniel Dett (1882-1943) was a Canadian-American composer, organist, pianist, choral director, and music professor. He was a leading Black composer known for his use of African-American folk songs and spirituals as the basis for choral and piano compositions.

## Personal Life
Dett was born in Drummondville, Ontario (now part of Niagara Falls, Ontario), Canada to Charlotte (Washington) Dett and Robert T. Dett. His ancestors were among the slaves who escaped to the North and settled in that slave-founded town. [1] As a child, his mother directed him to study Shakespeare, Longfellow and Tennyson, and commit passages to memory. [1] In 1893, the family moved over the border to Niagara Falls, New York. [1]

## Career
Dett began piano lessons at a young age and played piano for his local church as a teenager. [1] He studied at the Oliver Willis Halstead Conservatory of Music, the Lockport Conservatory, and the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, where he first encountered the practice of incorporating spirituals in classical music. [1][2] 

Dett's most important work began in 1913 at the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, where he trained the choir to a high level of musical excellence. [3] He rose to the position of director of the Music Department at Hampton in 1926, becoming the first Black person to hold that job. [3] Dett continued to study music at prestigious institutions like Harvard University, the American Conservatory, Columbia University, and the Eastman School of Music, where he earned a Master's degree in 1932. [1][2][3]

## Achievements
Dett published over 100 compositions, including major choral works like "Chariot Jubilee" and the oratorio "The Ordering of Moses", both of which used African-American spirituals as thematic material. [3] His arrangements of spirituals, such as "Listen to the Lambs", "Somebody's Knocking at Your Door", and "Don't Be Weary, Traveler", became very popular. [3] In 1926, Oberlin Conservatory awarded Dett an honorary Doctor of Music degree, the first such honor for an African American. [3] He also served as president of The National Association of Negro Musicians from 1924 to 1926. [2]
