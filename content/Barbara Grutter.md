Based on the search results, here is a summary of the key details about Barbara Grutter:

Barbara Grutter was a white 43-year-old mother who had started her own business and graduated from college 18 years earlier when she applied to the University of Michigan Law School in 1997. [1] She was placed on a waiting list for admission and then rejected. [1] Grutter then filed a lawsuit against the University of Michigan, alleging that she was discriminated against on the basis of her race because the University's admissions policy granted preferences to black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants. [1][2]

The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the University of Michigan Law School's admissions policy in the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger. [3][4] The Court ruled that the Law School's consideration of race as a factor in admissions decisions was constitutional, as it was narrowly tailored to further the compelling interest of achieving a diverse student body. [4] The Court found that the Law School's policy did not use racial quotas, but rather considered race as one factor among many in a holistic review of each applicant. [3][5]

So in summary, Barbara Grutter was the white plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case Grutter v. Bollinger, which upheld the use of affirmative action in university admissions. [1][2][3][4][5]
