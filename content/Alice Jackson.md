Alice Jackson was a Black woman who applied to the University of Virginia in 1935 to study romance languages, but was rejected by the UVA Board of Visitors due to her race.[4] She was part of the trailblazing generation that faced discrimination in higher education as Black Americans sought access to predominantly white institutions.[4]

Alice Jackson was the first Black applicant denied admission to the University of Virginia in 1935. [1][2]

## Personal Life
Alice Jackson was born on June 2, 1913 in Richmond, Virginia. She received a bachelor's degree in English from Virginia Union University in 1934. [5]

## Denied Admission to UVA
In 1935, at the age of 22, Alice Jackson applied to the University of Virginia to pursue a master's degree in French. However, she was denied admission due to the state's segregation policies at the time. [1][2] 

Instead, the state of Virginia paid for Jackson to attend Columbia University, where she earned a master's degree. [1][2]

## Later Life
After being denied admission to UVA, Jackson went on to have a career as a teacher at Virginia Union University. [5] In 1990, she was invited back to UVA as the keynote speaker at the Office of African-American Affairs' annual awards banquet, where she reflected on her experience being denied admission decades earlier. [2]

Alice Jackson Stuart passed away on June 13, 2001 at the age of 88. [5]

## Significance
