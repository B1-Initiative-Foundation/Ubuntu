Patrick Francis Healy was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who served as an influential president of [[Georgetown University]], becoming known as its "second founder". [1][3][4][5]

Healy was born in [[Macon]], [[Georgia]] to an Irish American father and a mother who was one-eighth Black. Under Georgia law at the time, Healy's father technically owned his wife and children as slaves. Healy and his siblings were sent north by their father to be educated, and Healy continued his higher education at the [[Catholic University of Louvain]] in Belgium, where he received his doctorate in philosophy in 1864. [1][3][4][5]

Healy returned to the United States and started as the chair of philosophy at [[Georgetown University]]. He was elected president of the university in 1873 and appointed rector the following year. During his presidency, Healy sought to transform Georgetown into a modern university, overseeing a period of extensive growth. He increased the prominence of the sciences, raised the standards of the School of Medicine, and oversaw a rapid expansion of the Law School. He also constructed the university's flagship building, Healy Hall, which left the institution in substantial debt. [1][3][4][5]

In 1882, Healy went to live with his brother, [[James Healy]], the Bishop of [[Portland, Maine]], and the two traveled extensively throughout Europe. Afterwards, Healy returned to pastoral work in [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York City]], before returning to Georgetown, where he died in 1910. [1][3][4][5]

Though Healy considered himself and was largely accepted as White, he was posthumously recognized as the first Black American to become a Jesuit, earn a PhD, and become the president of a predominantly White university. [1][3][4][5]

Patrick Francis Healy was the first African American to earn a doctorate, become a Jesuit priest, and serve as president of a major university in the United States.

## Personal Life
Healy was born in 1834 in Macon, Georgia to an Irish American father and a mother who was a mulatto domestic slave. Due to laws restricting education for illegitimate children and slaves, Healy and his siblings were sent north to a Quaker school in Flushing, New York for their education. Healy and his brothers James and Sherwood later enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, where they followed their Catholic faith and eventually joined the priesthood. [1][2]

## Career
After graduating from Holy Cross in 1850, Healy entered the Jesuit order and was sent to Europe to continue his studies. He attended the University of Louvain in Belgium, where he earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1865, becoming the first African American to earn a PhD. [1][2] 

Healy was then ordained as a Jesuit priest in 1866. He returned to the United States and taught philosophy at Georgetown University. In 1874, he became the 29th president of Georgetown, making him the first African American to lead a major predominantly white university in the country. As president, Healy instituted significant changes that helped transform Georgetown from a small 19th century college into a major 20th century university. [1]

## Achievements
In addition to being the first African American to earn a doctorate, become a Jesuit priest, and serve as president of a major university, Healy is also credited with overseeing the construction of one of Georgetown's major campus buildings, which was later named Healy Hall in his honor. [1]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Throughout his life, Healy's racial identity was the subject of speculation, as he was considered "negro" under the one-drop rule that prevailed at the time, despite having an Irish American father. Some students who knew of his racial background made disparaging comments about him while he was teaching at Holy Cross. [2]
