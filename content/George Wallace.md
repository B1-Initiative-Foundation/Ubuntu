George Corley Wallace Jr. was an American politician and judge who served as the 45th governor of Alabama for four terms. He is remembered for his staunch segregationist and populist views. During Wallace's tenure as governor, he promoted "industrial development, low taxes, and trade schools." Wallace sought the United States presidency as a Democratic Party candidate three times, and once as an American Independent Party candidate, being unsuccessful each time. Wallace opposed desegregation and supported the policies of "Jim Crow" during the Civil Rights Movement.[2][4]

## Personal Life
George Corley Wallace Jr. was born on October 17, 1951 in Eufaula, Alabama to George Wallace and Lurleen Burns Wallace, both of whom served as Democratic governors of Alabama.[1][2] He had three sisters: Bobbi Jo Wallace Parsons, Peggy Sue Wallace Kennedy, and Janie Lee Wallace Dye.[2] Wallace lived in the Alabama Governor's Mansion in Montgomery during his parents' terms as governor from 1963 to 1968, after which he lived with relatives.[2] He graduated from Sidney Lanier High School in Montgomery in 1970, completed a bachelor's degree in history at Huntingdon College in Montgomery in 1976, and did graduate work in political science and public administration at Auburn University.[2] Wallace had two sons, George Corley Wallace IV and Robert Kelly Wallace, from his second marriage, though his son George Corley Wallace IV died by suicide in 2009 at the age of 25.[2] Wallace was married three times - first to an unknown woman, then to Angela Dawn Shoemaker in 1990 (divorced in 1991), and finally to Elizabeth Grimes Maynor in 2000, with whom he has two stepdaughters.[2]

## Career
From 1978 to 1987, Wallace worked at Troy University in Troy, Alabama, serving as the director of financial aid and alumni affairs from 1978 to 1982, and then as vice president of development and alumni affairs from 1983 to 1987.[2] In 1986, Wallace was elected Alabama State Treasurer as a Democrat, and was easily re-elected in 1990.[2] In 1992, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in Alabama's 2nd congressional district, but lost in an upset to Republican Terry Everett.[2] In 1994, Wallace ran for lieutenant governor but finished third.[2] After leaving the treasurer's office, Wallace worked at the Center for Government and Public Affairs at Auburn University Montgomery.[2] In 1998, he switched affiliations to the Republican Party and was elected to the Alabama Public Service Commission (Position 2), serving from 1999 to 2007.[2]

## Achievements
Wallace did not appear to have any major achievements or accolades beyond his political career in Alabama. He served multiple terms as state treasurer and was elected to the Alabama Public Service Commission, but did not seem to make any significant contributions or found any notable organizations.

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Wallace's father, George Wallace, was a notorious segregationist who served as governor of Alabama and ran for president on a pro-segregation platform.[3][4] The younger Wallace was not directly involved in his father's segregationist policies, but as the son of such a controversial figure, he likely faced scrutiny and criticism throughout his own political career.[1][2]
