Eva Beatrice Dykes was the first African American woman in the United States to complete the requirements for a Ph.D. and the third African American woman to receive a doctoral degree. [1][2][3][4][5] She was born in Washington, D.C. in 1893 and attended Howard University, graduating summa cum laude in 1914. [1][2][4] 

Dykes then applied to Radcliffe College, an all-women's college affiliated with Harvard University, to pursue a master's degree. However, Radcliffe did not accept her Howard degree, so she was required to earn a second bachelor's degree from Radcliffe, which she completed magna cum laude in 1917. [1][2][3][4] She went on to earn her master's degree from Radcliffe in 1918. [1][2][4]

While at Radcliffe, Dykes was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. [2][4] She returned to Howard University in 1917 to complete her doctoral studies, earning a Ph.D. in 1921, becoming the first African American woman to complete the requirements for a Ph.D. [1][2][3][4][5] Her dissertation focused on Alexander Pope's views on slavery and his influence on American writers. [2][4]

Dykes taught at Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C. from 1920 to 1929, before joining the faculty at Howard University, where she remained until 1944. [2][4] In 1944, she left Howard to teach at Oakwood College, a Seventh-day Adventist institution in Huntsville, Alabama, where she helped the school gain accreditation. [2][4] Dykes retired from full-time teaching in 1968, but continued to write a regular column for the Adventist publication Message Magazine until 1984. [2] The library at Oakwood College is named in her honor. [2]

Eva Beatrice Dykes was a pioneering African American educator and scholar who made history as the first Black woman in the United States to complete the requirements for a doctoral degree.

## Personal Life
Dykes was born on August 13, 1893 in Washington, D.C. to James Stanley Dykes and Martha Ann (Howard) Dykes. She attended M Street High School (later renamed Dunbar High School) and graduated summa cum laude from Howard University with a B.A. in 1914. [1][2] Several members of Dykes' family, including her father, uncles, and sister, had also studied at Howard University. [3]

After graduating from Howard, Dykes spent a year teaching English and Latin at Walden University in Nashville, Tennessee. She then enrolled at Radcliffe College, where she earned a second B.A. magna cum laude in 1917 and a M.A. in 1918. [1][2][3] In 1920, Dykes joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a commitment she took seriously throughout her life. [2]

## Career
Dykes began teaching at Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C. in 1920 and received her Ph.D. from Radcliffe (now part of Harvard University) in 1921, becoming the first Black American woman to complete the requirements for a doctoral degree. [1][2][3][4][5] Her dissertation was titled "Pope and His Influence in America from 1715 to 1815". [1]

After receiving her doctorate, Dykes continued teaching at Dunbar High School until 1929, when she joined the faculty at Howard University as a professor of English. She won numerous teaching awards during her 15 years at Howard. [1][2] In 1944, Dykes joined the faculty of Oakwood College (now Oakwood University) in Huntsville, Alabama as the Chair of the English Department, becoming the first staff member there to hold a doctoral degree. She was instrumental in helping the college achieve accreditation. [1][2]

Dykes was a prolific writer, authoring several books including "Readings from Negro Authors for Schools and Colleges" and "The Negro in English Romantic Thought: Or a Study in Sympathy for the Oppressed". She also wrote a column for the Seventh-day Adventist periodical "Message Magazine" for 50 years from 1934 to 1984. [1][2]

## Achievements
Dykes was the third African American woman to earn a doctoral degree, after Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander and Georgiana R. Simpson, who both received their Ph.D.s in 1921. However, Dykes was the first to complete all the requirements, though she received her diploma a week after the other two. [3][4][5]

In 1973, the library at Oakwood College was named in Dykes' honor. In 1975, the Seventh-day Adventist Church awarded her its Citation of Excellence. She was also made a Professor Emerita at Oakwood in 1980. [1][2]
