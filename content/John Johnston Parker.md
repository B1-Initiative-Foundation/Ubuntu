John J. Parker was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Herbert Hoover in 1930, but his nomination was rejected by the Senate in a 39-41 vote.[1][3] This was the only rejection of a Supreme Court nominee between 1894 and 1968.[3] Parker's nomination faced opposition from the American Federation of Labor and the NAACP due to his past anti-labor and racially insensitive remarks.[1][3] Despite the initial support for his nomination, including from Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Parker's controversial past actions ultimately led to his rejection by the Senate.[1][3]

John Johnston Parker was an unsuccessful nominee for associate justice of the United States Supreme Court in 1930. [1][4]

## Personal Life
Parker was born on November 20, 1885 in Monroe, North Carolina. He was the oldest of four children born to Frances Ann (Johnston) and John Daniel Parker. Parker was a descendant of William Bradford, a founder of Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, and of Supreme Court Justice James Iredell. [1]

## Career
After graduating from the University of North Carolina with a law degree, Parker practiced law in North Carolina. He was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, North Carolina Attorney General, and Governor of North Carolina in the early 1900s. [1] From 1923 to 1924, Parker served as a special assistant to the U.S. Attorney General, prosecuting alleged frauds from the Wilson administration during World War I. [1] 

In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge appointed Parker to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, where he served as a judge until his death in 1958. [1] Parker also served as an alternate judge on the International Military Tribunal at the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals from 1945-1946. [1][2]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
In 1930, President Herbert Hoover nominated Parker to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the nomination was rejected by the Senate. This was due to Parker's past anti-labor rulings and comments he made in a 1920 gubernatorial campaign about the "participation of the Negro in politics" being a "source of evil and danger to both races."[1][4] The NAACP and American Federation of Labor strongly opposed his nomination.
