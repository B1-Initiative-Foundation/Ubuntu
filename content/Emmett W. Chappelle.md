Emmett Chappelle's groundbreaking work in bioluminescence led to the development of methods to detect life on Mars and improved medical diagnostics. He held 14 patents and was awarded NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 1994 for his contributions[1][2][3][4][5].

Emmett W. Chappelle was an American scientist who made significant contributions in the fields of medicine, food science, and astrochemistry. Here is a summary of his life and achievements:

## Personal Life
Emmett Chappelle was born on October 24, 1925 in Phoenix, Arizona to Viola White Chappelle and Isom Chappelle, who were farmers. [1] He attended the segregated Phoenix Union Colored High School, where he graduated at the top of his class in 1942. [3] After high school, Chappelle was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in the 92nd Infantry Division, known as the "Buffalo Soldiers", during World War II. [4] He was wounded twice during his military service. [4]

## Career
After returning from the war, Chappelle attended Phoenix College and earned an associate's degree in electrical engineering. [3] He then went on to earn a B.S. in biology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1950. [3] From 1950 to 1953, Chappelle taught biochemistry at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, while also conducting his own research. [3] He later earned an M.S. in biology from the University of Washington in 1954. [2]

In 1958, Chappelle began working at the Research Institute for Advanced Studies in Baltimore, where he discovered that single-celled organisms like algae are photosynthetic. [2] He later joined NASA as an exobiologist and astrochemist, working on instruments designed to collect soil samples from Mars. [2][4] During this time, Chappelle developed a method to detect adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using chemicals that cause bioluminescence in fireflies. [1][2][4]

## Achievements
Chappelle's work on bioluminescence led to 14 U.S. patents and over 35 peer-reviewed scientific publications. [1][2][3] In 1994, he was awarded NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for his contributions. [2] Chappelle was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007 for his work on bioluminescence. [4] He has been honored as one of the 100 most distinguished African American scientists and engineers of the 20th century. [1][2][3]
