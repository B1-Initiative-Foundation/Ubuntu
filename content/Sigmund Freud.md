Sigmund Freud was the founder of psychoanalysis, a method for treating mental illness and a theory explaining human behavior. He believed that events in our childhood have a great influence on our adult lives, shaping our personality. Freud introduced several influential concepts, including the Oedipus complex, dream analysis, and the structural model of the psyche divided into the id, ego, and superego. He published numerous influential works throughout his career, such as "The Interpretation of Dreams" and "The Psychopathology of Everyday Life".[1][2][3][4]

Here is a concise biography of Sigmund Freud based on the provided search results:

## Personal Life
Sigmund Freud was born on May 6, 1856 in Freiberg, Moravia (now Příbor, Czech Republic) to a Jewish family of wool merchants. [1] His family moved to Vienna in 1860, where Freud spent most of his life. [1] Freud was the eldest of eight children. [2] He initially wanted to become a lawyer but later developed an interest in medicine, graduating with an MD from the University of Vienna in 1881. [2]

## Career
Freud established a private practice in Vienna in 1886 to treat nervous disorders. [2] He is the founder of psychoanalysis, a theory of how the mind works and a method of treating mental distress. [1] Freud's key concepts include the unconscious, infantile sexuality, and the tripartite model of the mind (id, ego, superego). [2][3] He wrote extensively on psychoanalytic theory and its implications for understanding society, culture, and human behavior. [1] Freud's work was initially not well received, but his reputation and influence grew significantly after he gave lectures in the United States in 1909. [3]

## Achievements
Freud is considered the father of psychoanalysis and his ideas have had a profound impact on psychology, psychiatry, and the humanities. [3][4] He introduced concepts like the Oedipus complex, dream analysis, and the structural model of the psyche that are now widely used. [2] Freud attracted many followers who formed the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. [2]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Freud's emphasis on sexuality and the unconscious were seen as scandalous in the repressive "Victorian" society in which he lived. [2] Some of his followers, like Carl Jung and Alfred Adler, later broke away and developed their own schools of thought, leading to the emergence of "neo-Freudians". [2] Freud's claims about the scientific status of psychoanalysis remain controversial. [3]
