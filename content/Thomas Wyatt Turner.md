Thomas Wyatt Turner was born to sharecropper parents in Hughesville, Maryland.[1][2] After his father's death, he was sent to live with an aunt and uncle and attended Episcopal schools, as Catholic schools had refused him entry.[2] He went on to earn a B.S. (1901) and M.A. (1905) from Howard University.[2] 

In 1921, Turner became the first Black person to earn a PhD in Botany from Cornell University, with his dissertation titled "The physiological effects of salts in altering the ratio of top to root growth".[2][3] He then taught at the Tuskegee Institute and various public schools in Baltimore before becoming a professor of Botany at Howard University from 1914 to 1924.[2]

Turner was a founding member of the NAACP in 1909, serving as the organization's first secretary, and was also active in promoting Black voting rights.[2] He later organized a citywide NAACP membership drive in Washington, D.C. and was eventually honored with a lifetime membership.[2]

In addition to his civil rights work, Turner was a founding member and president of the Federated Colored Catholics.[2] After retiring from Hampton Institute in 1945 due to glaucoma, Turner's life story was published in the book "From Sharecropper to Scientist: The Memoir of Thomas Wyatt Turner, Ph.D., 1877-1978".[3]

Cornell University has since created the Thomas Wyatt Turner Fellowship to support graduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds in agricultural research and development.[3][4][5]
