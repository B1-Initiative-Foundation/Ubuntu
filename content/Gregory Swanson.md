Gregory Hayes Swanson (1924-1992) was the first African American student admitted to the University of Virginia. [2][3][4]

## Personal Life
Swanson graduated from Howard University in 1945 with a Bachelor's degree in political science. He then earned his law degree from Howard University as well. [4]

## Career
After law school, Swanson worked as a practicing attorney, first clerking for law firms in Richmond and Danville, Virginia. In 1949, he applied to the LL.M. program at the University of Virginia School of Law, stating his "primary reason" was his "desire to teach."[4]

## Achievements
Despite the University of Virginia's Board of Visitors initially rejecting Swanson's application due to Virginia's segregation laws, Swanson filed a lawsuit with the help of the NAACP, including Thurgood Marshall. In 1950, a federal court ruled in Swanson's favor, and he became the first African American student to attend the University of Virginia. [2][3][4] This landmark case laid the foundation for desegregation at the University.

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
During his time at UVA, Swanson faced a climate of racial prejudice and was excluded from many social activities. However, he remained an active participant in University life, attending events and helping organize the YMCA's Committee for Racial Understanding. [4]

## Bibliography
Swanson did not complete his LL.M. thesis within the two-year deadline and did not receive the degree. After leaving UVA, he practiced law in Martinsville and Alexandria, Virginia. In 1961, he joined the legal staff of the IRS, where he remained until his retirement in 1984. [4]
