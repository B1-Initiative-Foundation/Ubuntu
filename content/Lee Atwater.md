Lee Atwater was an American political consultant and strategist for the Republican Party. He was an adviser to Republican U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and served as chairman of the Republican National Committee.[1][4]

## Personal Life
Atwater was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1951. When he was 10 years old, his family moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he attended A.C. Flora High School.[4] Despite being a poor student, his mother arranged for him to attend Newberry College, a Lutheran school near Columbia, where he graduated in 1973.[4] In 1977, he earned a master's degree in communications from the University of South Carolina.[4]

## Career
Atwater began his political career as an intern in the Washington, D.C. office of U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond in the 1970s. He later became chair of the South Carolina chapter of the College Republicans.[4] Atwater established a political consulting firm in Columbia and managed the campaigns of numerous Republican candidates for local offices.[4] 

In 1980, Atwater helped Ronald Reagan win the Republican presidential primary in South Carolina by falsely characterizing Reagan's opponent, George H.W. Bush, as a strong supporter of gun control.[4] Atwater then served as the Southern coordinator of the Reagan-Bush presidential campaign.[4] After Reagan's election, Atwater was named deputy political director in the Reagan White House.[4]

In 1988, Atwater served as the campaign director for George H.W. Bush's successful presidential campaign against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. Atwater was responsible for Bush's generally negative campaign, which aggressively portrayed Dukakis as unpatriotic and soft on crime.[4] This included a notorious attack ad that effectively blamed Dukakis for the rape of a white woman by a Black convict named Willie Horton, who had escaped police custody while on a weekend furlough.[4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Atwater's political tactics were highly controversial, with critics accusing him of using divisive, racist, and unethical campaign strategies.[3] In the final years of his life, Atwater publicly apologized to Dukakis for the "naked cruelty" of the 1988 campaign.[1][4] However, his unpublished memoirs reveal that he was driven solely by a desire to win, rather than any concern for governing or the public good.[3]

## Bibliography
Atwater did not author any books, but his life and political career have been the subject of several biographies and documentaries, including the 2008 film "Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story".[1]
