Eddie G. Robinson was an American football coach who spent 56 years as the head coach at Grambling State University, a historically black college in Louisiana. [1][2][4]

## Personal Life
Robinson was born in 1919 in Jackson, Louisiana to a sharecropper's son and a domestic worker. He graduated from McKinley Senior High School in Baton Rouge in 1937 and briefly attended Southern University before earning his bachelor's degree from Leland College in Baker, Louisiana. He later obtained a master's degree from the University of Iowa in 1954. [2][4]

Robinson married his wife Doris, and they had two children - Eddie Jr. and Lillian Rose. Doris Robinson passed away in 2015 at the age of 96. [2]

## Career
Robinson began his coaching career at Grambling (then called Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute) in 1941, initially with no assistants and a limited budget. Despite these challenges, he quickly turned the program around, leading the team to a perfect 8-0 season in his second year. [1][2][4]

Over his 56-year tenure, Robinson built Grambling into a small college football powerhouse, winning 17 Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) titles and several national black college championships. He retired in 1997 with a record of 408 wins, 165 losses, and 15 ties - the most wins by any college football coach at the time. [1][2][4]

## Achievements
Robinson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997. The Football Writers Association of America's Coach of the Year award is named after him, and Grambling named its football stadium the Eddie Robinson Stadium. [1][2]

Over 200 of Robinson's players went on to play in the NFL, including Hall of Famers Willie Davis, Willie Brown, and Buck Buchanan. He was instrumental in providing opportunities for black players during the era of segregation in college football. [1][2][4]
