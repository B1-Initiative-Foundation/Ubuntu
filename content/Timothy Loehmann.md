Timothy Loehmann is a former police officer who was involved in the 2014 shooting death of 12-year-old [[Tamir Rice]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]]. [1][2][3][4]

Loehmann was hired by the Cleveland Police Department in 2014, despite having a troubled history from his previous job at the Independence Police Department, where he was deemed emotionally unfit for duty. [3][4] The Cleveland department did not properly check Loehmann's background before hiring him. [4]

In November 2014, Loehmann responded to a call about a person with a gun at a park in Cleveland. Within seconds of arriving, Loehmann shot and killed Tamir Rice, who was playing with a toy pellet gun. Loehmann was not charged for the shooting. [1][2][3][4]

In 2017, Loehmann was fired from the Cleveland Police Department, not for the shooting of Tamir Rice, but for providing inaccurate details on his job application. [1][2] 

After leaving Cleveland, Loehmann applied for and was briefly hired as a police officer in Tioga, [[Pennsylvania]] in 2022, but withdrew his application after public outcry over his hiring. [1][2] This incident highlighted the issue of "wandering cops" who are able to move between police departments despite histories of misconduct.

Here is a concise and accurate response to the question about Timothy Loehmann, drawing from the given search results:

Timothy Loehmann is the former Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in 2014. [1][2][3][5] Loehmann, who is white, shot and killed Tamir, a Black 12-year-old, within seconds of arriving at a park where Tamir was playing with a pellet gun that officials said was indistinguishable from a real pistol. [1][3][5] The shooting sparked nationwide protests over law enforcement's use of deadly force against Black people. [1][2]

Loehmann was fired from the Cleveland Police Department in 2017, not for the shooting itself, but for lying on his job application and failing to disclose that he had previously been deemed unfit for duty at a previous police department due to an "inability to emotionally function."[1][2][5] However, a grand jury declined to indict Loehmann, and the Justice Department did not file federal charges against him. [1][2]

Despite the controversy surrounding Loehmann's actions, he was recently hired as the sole police officer in the small Pennsylvania borough of Tioga, sparking outrage from Tamir Rice's mother and others. [1][2][3][4][5] After public backlash, Loehmann resigned from the Tioga position just days after being sworn in. [1][2][3]
