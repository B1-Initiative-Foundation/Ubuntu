Wesley A. Brown was the first African American to graduate from the United States Naval Academy in 1949.[1][2][3] He faced significant discrimination and challenges as a black midshipman, but succeeded through his academic ability, perseverance, and support from some classmates like future President Jimmy Carter.[1][2] 

After graduating, Brown served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years as a civil engineer, working on projects in the Philippines, Liberia, Antarctica, and Cuba among other locations.[2][3] He retired in 1969 and later worked at Howard University as a facilities planner.[3] 

The U.S. Naval Academy dedicated the Wesley Brown Field House in his honor in 2008, recognizing his pioneering achievement as the first African American graduate.[2][4] Brown was also awarded the National Society of Black Engineers Golden Torch Legacy Award in 2009.[3]

Here is a concise biography of Wesley A. Brown, the first African-American to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy:

## Personal Life
Wesley A. Brown was born on April 3, 1927 in Baltimore, Maryland. He grew up in a modest household in Washington, D.C., where his father delivered groceries and his mother worked in a dry cleaning shop. Brown's great-grandparents had been slaves. [3]

## Career
In 1945, Brown was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy, becoming the sixth African-American admitted to the institution. He faced intense discrimination and harassment from his fellow midshipmen during his time at the academy, including racial slurs, social ostracization, and fabricated disciplinary infractions that nearly led to his expulsion. [3][4] However, with the support of sympathetic upperclassmen like his track teammate Jimmy Carter, Brown persevered and graduated in 1949 as the first African-American to complete a Naval Academy education. [2][3]

After graduating, Brown served 20 years in the Navy's Civil Engineer Corps, working on projects such as designing a water treatment facility in Cuba, building roads across Liberia, and constructing an air station in the Philippines. [3][4] He retired as a Lieutenant Commander in 1969.

## Achievements
Brown's graduation from the Naval Academy in 1949 was a landmark achievement in military history, breaking down racial barriers that had previously prevented African-Americans from completing their education at the prestigious institution. [3][4] In 2008, the Naval Academy dedicated a $50 million indoor track facility in Brown's honor. [3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
