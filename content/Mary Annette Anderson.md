Mary Annette Anderson was the first Black woman to graduate from Middlebury College in Vermont in 1899[1][2][3][4]. She was born in 1874 in Shoreham, Vermont to a Black father, William Anderson, and a French-Canadian and Native American mother, Philomene[1][2]. 

##Personal Life
Anderson attended the Northfield Seminary, a private high school in Massachusetts, before enrolling at Middlebury College[1][2]. Her younger brother, William J. Anderson Jr., later became the second Black person to serve in the Vermont General Assembly[1].

##Career
At Middlebury, Anderson excelled academically, graduating as valedictorian and becoming the first Black student elected to the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa honor society[1][2][3][4][5]. However, despite her achievements, Anderson did not receive any teaching offers in New England after graduation[1]. 

She then taught for one year at Straight University, a historically Black university in New Orleans, before being appointed as a professor of English grammar and history at Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she taught for seven years[1][2]. In 1907, Anderson married Walter Lucius Smith, the principal of the Paul Laurence Dunbar School in Washington, D.C., and she gave up teaching at that time[2].

##Achievements
Anderson's graduation from Middlebury College as the first Black woman was a significant milestone, as it helped change the perception of what it meant to be a college student in Vermont[1]. She was recognized as a trailblazer and a remarkable woman who broke barriers in education for Black women across the United States[5].
