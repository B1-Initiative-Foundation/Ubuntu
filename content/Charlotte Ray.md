Charlotte E. Ray was the first African-American woman to graduate from an American law school and become a licensed attorney in the United States. [2][4] She graduated from Howard University School of Law in 1872 and was admitted to the District of Columbia bar, becoming one of the first women of any race to practice law in the District. [2][4]

Ray opened her own law office in Washington, D.C. but faced significant challenges due to racial and gender discrimination, and was unable to sustain her legal practice. [2][4] She later returned to New York and became a school teacher. [4]

Despite the obstacles she faced, Ray's pioneering accomplishments as the first Black female lawyer in the U.S. made her a role model and advocate for the recognition and advancement of Black women and all women in the legal profession. [2][4] The Minority Corporate Counsel Association presents an annual award named after her to honor exceptional achievements by women lawyers. [5]

Charlotte E. Ray (1850-1911) was the first African-American woman to graduate from a law school and the first to formally practice law in the United States.[1][2]

## Personal Life
Charlotte E. Ray was born on January 13, 1850 in New York City. Her father was a prominent abolitionist minister.[2] She attended the Institution for the Education of Colored Youth in Washington, D.C., one of the few educational institutions at the time that educated African-American girls.[2]

## Career
In 1869, Ray began teaching at Howard University, which had been established in 1867 to educate emancipated slaves and their descendants.[2] During her first year of teaching, she was accepted into the Howard School of Law, where she applied under the name "C.E. Ray" because the university was reluctant to admit women to its law program.[2] 

Ray graduated from Howard Law School in 1872, becoming the first African-American woman to do so.[1][2] She was then admitted to the District of Columbia bar, making her one of the first women of any race to practice law in the District.[1] Ray opened her own law practice in the District, specializing in commercial law. However, due to race and gender discrimination, she was unable to maintain her practice and returned to New York in 1879, where she worked as a teacher in Brooklyn.[2]

## Achievements
Ray's graduation from Howard Law School and admission to the D.C. bar made her a pioneering figure, as women - and particularly women of color - were largely barred from the legal profession in the 19th century.[1][2] She was active in the women's suffrage movement until her death at age 60.[2]
