Samuel Proctor Massie Jr. was an African American chemist who overcame racial barriers to become one of America's greatest chemists in research and teaching. He worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II and later became the first African American faculty member at the United States Naval Academy[1][2].

Samuel Proctor Massie Jr. (1919-2005) was an African American chemist who overcame significant racial barriers to become a pioneering researcher and educator. Here is a summary of his life and accomplishments:

## Personal Life
Massie was born in Little Rock, Arkansas to school teachers Samuel Proctor Massie Sr. and Earlee Jacko Massie. He had one younger brother. Massie was a child prodigy, graduating from high school at age 13. Despite being denied admission to the University of Arkansas due to his race, he went on to earn a bachelor's degree summa cum laude from Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College (now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff) in 1937 at age 18, and a master's degree in chemistry from Fisk University in 1940.[1][2]

## Career
During World War II, Massie worked on the Manhattan Project at Iowa State University, contributing research on converting uranium isotopes into liquid compounds for the atomic bomb.[1][4] After completing his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1946, he taught at several historically Black colleges and universities, including Langston University and Fisk University.[1][2]

In 1963, Massie became the president of North Carolina College (now North Carolina Central University).[1][2] In 1966, he was appointed as the first African American professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he chaired the Chemistry Department until 1981.[1][3][4] His research at the Naval Academy focused on developing treatments for mental illness, malaria, meningitis, gonorrhea, herpes, and cancer.[1][4]

## Achievements
Massie's pioneering work and contributions to chemistry were widely recognized. In 1998, he was named one of the 75 most distinguished chemists of the 20th century by Chemical and Engineering News, one of only three African Americans to receive this honor.[1][2][4] The U.S. Department of Energy also created the Dr. Samuel P. Massie Chairs of Excellence in 1994 to provide African American students opportunities to pursue environmental research.[1]
