Here is a concise biography of Marcia Rachel Clark:

## Personal Life
Marcia Clark was born on August 31, 1953 in Alameda, California to Israeli immigrant Abraham Kleks, a chemist for the FDA, and Rozlyn Mazur Kleks, a classical pianist. Due to her father's job, the family moved frequently during Clark's childhood, living in California, New York, Michigan, and Maryland.[2] Clark graduated from Susan E. Wagner High School in Staten Island, New York and earned a degree in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1976.[2] She then attended Southwestern University School of Law, earning a Juris Doctor degree in 1979.[2] At age 17, Clark was raped while visiting Eilat, Israel, an experience that influenced her decision to become a prosecutor.[1][4]

## Career
Clark passed the California bar in 1979 and initially worked in private practice and as a public defender before becoming a prosecutor for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office in 1981.[2] She quickly built a reputation as a skilled prosecutor, winning 19 successful homicide cases in just over a decade.[2] Clark's most high-profile case was the 1995 prosecution of O.J. Simpson for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.[1][2][5] Though the jury delivered a not guilty verdict, Clark's work on the case made her a household name.[1][2][5] After the trial, Clark took a leave of absence and ultimately resigned from the District Attorney's office in 1997.[2] She has since worked as an author, television correspondent, and television producer.[1][5]

## Achievements
Clark's successful prosecution of the Rebecca Schaeffer murder case led to legislation offering better protection for victims from stalkers.[2] She has also received praise from colleagues and adversaries alike for her tenacity, ethics, and competence as a prosecutor.[2] In 2016, Clark was portrayed by actress Sarah Paulson in the FX series "The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story", for which Paulson won a Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award.[5]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
During the O.J. Simpson trial, Clark faced intense media scrutiny and sexist attacks, with her appearance and personal life being heavily criticized.[4] Her former husband, Gabriel Horowitz, also sold topless photos of her to a tabloid during the trial.[1]
