James L. Sherley was an associate professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who left the institution in 2010 after being denied tenure and staging a hunger strike to protest a decision he contended was driven by racism.[1] Sherley was the first tenured African-American professor at MIT, having been named the Jones Ford Professor of Urban Affairs and Planning in 1972.[1] He was also involved in efforts to recruit and retain minority graduate students at MIT in the 1970s.[1]
