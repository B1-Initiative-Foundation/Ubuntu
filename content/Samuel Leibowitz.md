Leibowitz was a criminal defense attorney who became known for his sharp mind, exhaustive knowledge of the law, and commanding courtroom presence. In 1931, he agreed to work pro bono on an appeal for the Scottsboro Boys, nine black Alabama teenagers accused of raping two white girls. Despite strong evidence of their innocence, an all-white jury convicted the boys and sentenced them to death. [1][3][4]

Leibowitz challenged Alabama's exclusion of black people from juries, angering many locals and leading him to receive hate mail and death threats. He worked tirelessly for the next four years, taking the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which finally overturned the convictions. Leibowitz called the decision "a triumph for American justice."[1][3][4]

After his work on the Scottsboro Boys case, Leibowitz returned to his law practice in New York and later became a judge, serving on the New York State Supreme Court. He died in 1978 at the age of 84. [3][4]

Samuel Leibowitz was a prominent criminal defense attorney who is best known for representing the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine young African-American men who were falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama in 1931. [1][2][3]

## Personal Life
Leibowitz was born in 1893 in Ia»ôi, Romania to Jewish immigrant parents. His family moved to New York City in 1897, where he grew up in a tenement on the Lower East Side. Leibowitz was the first in his family to attend college, graduating from Cornell University and Cornell Law School. He married Belle Munves in 1919 and they had three children together. [4]

## Career
Leibowitz established a reputation as a skilled criminal defense attorney, known for his meticulous preparation, legal expertise, and commanding courtroom presence. Prior to the Scottsboro case, he had a remarkable record of 77 acquittals, 1 hung jury, and no convictions in 78 first-degree murder trials. [2]

## Scottsboro Boys Case
In 1931, Leibowitz was hired by the International Labor Defense, an affiliate of the Communist Party, to defend the Scottsboro Boys. Despite strong evidence of the defendants' innocence, an all-white jury convicted them. Leibowitz appealed the convictions all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which eventually overturned the verdicts in 1932 due to the systematic exclusion of black jurors. [1][3]

Leibowitz continued to defend the Scottsboro Boys over the next four years, through multiple retrials. He faced intense hostility and threats from the local Alabama community, requiring protection by the National Guard. Leibowitz's aggressive defense strategy and outspoken criticism of the trials angered many Southerners. [1][2][3]

By the mid-1930s, Leibowitz began to feel he was doing more harm than good to the Scottsboro Boys' case. He brought in a local Southern attorney as co-counsel, but the boys continued to be convicted. Ultimately, four of the nine were convicted, one pleaded guilty, and four were eventually released. [3]

## Later Career
After the Scottsboro trials, Leibowitz returned to his law practice in New York. He later served as a justice on the New York State Supreme Court, a position he held until his death in 1978 at the age of 84. [4]

In summary, Samuel Leibowitz was a renowned criminal defense lawyer who played a pivotal role in the Scottsboro Boys case, fighting tirelessly for their exoneration despite intense opposition and hostility in the segregated South. His efforts helped bring about important changes in the criminal justice system. [1][2][3]
