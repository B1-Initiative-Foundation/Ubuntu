According to the search results, Sam was a slave whose father had developed a comb-like tool to remove cotton seeds. Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who was tutoring the children of a plantation owner in South Carolina, heard about Sam's father's invention and used that as the basis for his cotton gin patent in 1794. The cotton gin, which mechanized the process of removing cotton seeds, greatly increased the profitability of cotton production and led to a massive expansion of slavery in the United States. While Sam's contribution was crucial, he was unable to patent or profit from his father's invention as a slave. The search results indicate that the story of Sam providing the key idea to Whitney is likely apocryphal, but it highlights how many important inventions by enslaved people went unrecognized at the time[1][2][4][5].

Based on the search results provided, it appears that the story of a slave named Sam being the original inventor of the key idea behind the cotton gin is likely an apocryphal tale, though it has been repeated in various sources over time.

The key points are:

- Eli Whitney patented the cotton gin in 1793 and is credited as the inventor[1][2].
- However, there are claims that Whitney's invention was based on the idea of a slave known only as "Sam", who had developed a comb-like tool to remove cotton seeds[3][4][5].
- The story of "Sam" providing the crucial idea to Whitney seems to have emerged later and its origins are unclear. Historians have not been able to find substantial proof to support this claim[3].
- While slaves did invent various technologies, they were often unable to patent them, and their contributions were frequently attributed to their white masters[5].
- The expansion of cotton production due to the cotton gin led to a massive increase in the slave population in the American South, from around 700,000 in 1790 to 3.2 million in 1850[1][2].

So in summary, while the story of a slave named Sam inventing the key idea behind the cotton gin is compelling, the historical evidence does not conclusively support this claim. Eli Whitney is generally credited as the inventor of the cotton gin, even though it's possible he built upon ideas or prototypes developed by enslaved individuals.
