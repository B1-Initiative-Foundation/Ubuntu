Washington to serve as the architect, planner and construction supervisor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, where he worked for nearly 40 years until 1933.[1][2][3][4] During his time at Tuskegee, Taylor designed many of the campus buildings, including the iconic Butler Chapel, which was considered his finest achievement.[1][2][3][4] He also served as the director of the Mechanical Industries Department and was eventually promoted to vice-principal of the institute.[1][2][3]
