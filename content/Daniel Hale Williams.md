Daniel Hale Williams was an American surgeon and hospital founder who made significant contributions to the medical field in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Here is a summary of his life and achievements:

## Personal Life
Daniel Hale Williams was born on January 18, 1856 in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania to Daniel Williams Jr. and Sarah Price. His family had a mixed racial heritage, with his father's side including German immigrants, Native Americans, and free Black Americans. After his father died when Williams was 9 years old, he was sent to live with relatives in Baltimore and later joined his mother and siblings in Rockford, Illinois. [1][2]

## Career
Williams studied medicine as an apprentice under Dr. Henry Palmer and later attended the Chicago Medical College (now Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine), graduating in 1883. He opened a private medical practice in Chicago, treating both Black and white patients. [1][2]

In 1891, Williams founded Provident Hospital, the first non-segregated hospital in the United States with an interracial staff. He served as the hospital's chief surgeon and also established a nursing school for African Americans. [1][3]

In 1894, Williams was appointed chief surgeon at Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C. He reorganized the hospital, improving surgical procedures and launching an ambulance service. He also co-founded the National Medical Association in 1895, a professional organization for Black medical practitioners. [1][2][3]

## Achievements
Williams is best known for performing one of the first successful open-heart surgeries in the United States in 1893, when he repaired a patient's pericardium (the membrane surrounding the heart) after a stab wound. This was a groundbreaking procedure at the time. [1][4]

In 1913, Williams became the first African-American charter member of the American College of Surgeons. He was also named one of the 100 Greatest African Americans by scholar Molefi Kete Asante in 2002. [1][2]
