Russell was one of the 63 people who worked together to found the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]] in 1909[1][4]. His participation stemmed from his experiences with violence and racism as a child, including his father nearly being hanged for opposing slavery[1]. Russell served on the NAACP's board of directors for the rest of his life[1].

Russell was also a member of the [[Socialist Party of America]], joining in 1908 as his convictions became more radical[1][2]. He ran for various political offices on the Socialist ticket, including governor of New York, but was never elected[2][3].

In addition to his journalism and political activism, Russell won the 1928 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for his book "The American Orchestra and Theodore Thomas"[3].

## Personal Life
Russell was born in 1860 in Davenport, Iowa. His father, Edward Russell, was the editor of the Davenport Gazette and an abolitionist[1][2]. The Russell family was staunchly religious Christian Evangelicals, with Charles' grandfather being a Baptist minister and his father a Sunday school superintendent and leader of the Iowa YMCA[2].

## Career
Russell began his journalism career working for his father's newspaper, and later wrote for several major newspapers including the New York World, New York Herald, and Chicago American[1][2]. He became known as a "muckraking" journalist, investigating and reporting on the horrors of capitalism and the poor working conditions faced by many, especially immigrants[3]. 

## NAACP Involvement
In 1909, Russell was one of the 63 people who worked together to found the NAACP[1][2][4]. He served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee in 1909 and as a board member of the NAACP for the rest of his life[4]. Russell's participation in founding the NAACP stemmed from his experiences with violence and racism as a child, including his father nearly being hanged for opposing slavery[2].

## Achievements
In addition to his journalism and NAACP work, Russell ran for various political offices as a Socialist Party candidate, including for Governor of New York, U.S. Senator from New York, and Mayor of New York City[2][3]. He also won the 1928 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for his book "The American Orchestra and Theodore Thomas"[1][3].

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Despite his progressive views and involvement in the NAACP, Russell's support for President Woodrow Wilson's decision to enter World War I led to his expulsion from the Socialist Party in 1917[2][3]. This put him at odds with the majority of the party's rank and file, who remained strongly anti-war.
