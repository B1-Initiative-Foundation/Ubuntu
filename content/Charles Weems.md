Charles Weems was one of the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine young African American men who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in Alabama in 1931. Weems, who was 19 years old at the time, was involved in the fight aboard the Southern Railroad freight train that led to the accusations. [1][2]

Weems was convicted of rape in 1931 and again in a second trial in 1937. He maintained a clean prison record and was paroled in 1943 after spending 12 years in some of Alabama's worst prisons. [3] 

In prison, Weems suffered greatly. He complained about being "half fed" and spent a lot of time thinking about "the ladies out in the world."[2] He was also beaten and tear-gassed for reading Communist literature that had been sent to him, which caused permanent eye injuries. In 1937, he contracted tuberculosis, and in 1938 he was stabbed by a prison guard who mistook him for another prisoner. [2]

After his release in 1943, Weems moved back to Atlanta, where he married and took a job in a laundry. However, the long-term effects of his mistreatment in prison likely took a toll, as he was reported to have died not long after his release due to tuberculosis. [3]

Based on the search results, here is a concise biography of Charles Weems, one of the Scottsboro Boys:

Charles Weems was the oldest of the Scottsboro Boys, at 19 years old when he was arrested in 1931. He was from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Weems had a difficult childhood - his mother died when he was 4 years old, and six of his seven siblings did not survive to adulthood. He dropped out of school in the fifth grade to work in a pharmacy after his father became ill. [1][4]

Weems was convicted of rape in 1931 and again in a second trial in 1937. In prison, he suffered greatly - he was beaten, tear-gassed for reading Communist literature, and contracted tuberculosis. In 1938, he was mistakenly stabbed by a prison guard. [1][2][4]

Despite his hardships, Weems maintained a clean prison record. He was paroled in 1943 and moved back to Atlanta, where he got married and took a job in a laundry. [1][2][4] In 2013, over 80 years after his conviction, Weems was posthumously pardoned by the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to formally exonerate him. [3]
