Virgil Darnell Hawkins was an African-American educator and Florida attorney who spent several decades of his life fighting for admission to practice law in Florida after having initially been denied admission to the University of Florida School of Law in 1949 due to racial segregation laws. [1][2][3] Despite facing numerous obstacles, Hawkins eventually earned his law degree from New England Law Boston in 1964 and was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1976 under a "diploma privilege" previously granted only to white attorneys. [3] Hawkins went on to practice law in Lake County, Florida until 1985. [3] His historic struggle for racial equality in higher education has been widely recognized, with many legal and non-legal organizations named after him. [3]

Virgil Darnell Hawkins was an African-American educator and Florida attorney who spent several decades of his life fighting for admission to practice law in Florida after having initially been denied admission to the University of Florida School of Law. [1]

## Personal Life
Hawkins was born in 1906 in Lake County, Florida to Virgil William Hawkins and Josephine Arbelle Hawkins (née Brown). He was one of eight children raised on a ten-acre homestead near Okahumpka, Florida. Both of Hawkins' parents placed great emphasis on their children's education. Hawkins' maternal grandfather was Alfred Brown Osgood, a prominent African Methodist Episcopal Church minister and American legislator. [1]

## Career
In 1949, Hawkins, who was the director of public relations for Bethune Cookman College, applied for admission to the University of Florida College of Law. He was academically eligible and possessed appropriate life experience qualifications, but was denied admission due to Florida's Jim Crow laws that racially segregated the state's universities. Hawkins and his allies fought this decision for nine years until they were ultimately victorious in the U.S. Supreme Court. [1][4][5]

## Achievements
Hawkins' long legal battle to gain admission to the University of Florida School of Law eventually opened the doors of Florida's public universities to African Americans, although he was not admitted himself. His perseverance and fight against racial segregation in higher education was a significant contribution to the civil rights movement. [1][4][5]
