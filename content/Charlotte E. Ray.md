Charlotte E. Ray was the first African-American woman to graduate from a law school and the first to formally practice law in the United States in 1872.[1][2] She graduated from Howard University School of Law and was admitted to the District of Columbia bar, becoming one of the first women of any race to practice law in the District.[1][2] Ray opened her own law office in Washington, D.C., but was forced to close it due to prejudice against African Americans and women, which made her business unsustainable.[1][2] She later became a teacher in Brooklyn, New York, and was involved in the women's suffrage movement.[2]

Charlotte E. Ray was the first African-American female lawyer in the United States. [1][2][3][4]

## Personal Life
Charlotte E. Ray was born on January 13, 1850 in New York City to Reverend Charles Bennett Ray, a prominent abolitionist, and his wife Charlotte Augusta Burroughs Ray. [1][2][3] She had six siblings, including two sisters named Henrietta Cordelia and Florence. [5] Education was highly valued by her father, who ensured that all of his daughters attended college. [5]

## Career
Ray attended the Institution for the Education of Colored Youth in Washington, D.C., one of the few schools at the time that educated African-American girls. [1][3] In 1869, she began teaching at Howard University, which had just been established two years prior. [1][3] That same year, she was accepted into the Howard School of Law, where she studied law and graduated in 1872, becoming the first woman to graduate from the law school. [1][2][3][4] 

Ray was admitted to the District of Columbia bar on March 2, 1872, making her the first African-American woman to be admitted to practice law in the United States. [1][2][3][4] She opened her own law practice in Washington, D.C., specializing in commercial law. [1][3] One of her most notable cases was representing Martha Gadley, an African-American woman seeking a divorce from an abusive husband. [3] However, Ray was unable to sustain her practice due to racial and gender discrimination. [1][3]

## Achievements
Ray's admission to the District of Columbia bar set a precedent for other women seeking to enter the legal profession. [4] She was also involved in the women's suffrage movement and joined the National Association of Colored Women. [3] After closing her law practice in 1879, Ray moved to New York City and became a teacher in the Brooklyn public school system. [1][3]
