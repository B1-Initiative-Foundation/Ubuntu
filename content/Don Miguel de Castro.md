Don Miguel de Castro was a Congolese emissary who traveled to the Dutch Republic in 1643 to negotiate support from the Dutch West India Company in a conflict between the Count of Sonho and King Garcia II of Kongo.[1][3] 

The painting "Portrait of Dom Miguel de Castro, Emissary of Congo" was created in 1643 by the Dutch Golden Age painter Jasper or Jeronimus Becx during Dom Miguel's stay in Middelburg, Netherlands.[3] The painting depicts Dom Miguel dressed in European fashion, including a green velvet suit with golden ribbons and buttons, a wide-brimmed hat with a red ostrich feather, and a sword.[1] 

Dom Miguel traveled with a few servants to the Dutch Republic via Dutch Brazil, where they were received by Governor John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen.[3] The three portraits of Dom Miguel and his servants were later donated by John Maurice to King Frederick III of Denmark, which is why they ended up in the collection of the National Gallery of Denmark.[3]

The portraits provide a rare glimpse into the diplomatic relations between African leaders and European colonial powers in the 17th century, as the Dutch West India Company sought to maintain good relations with leaders in West Africa during this period of colonial expansion and the transatlantic slave trade.[1]
