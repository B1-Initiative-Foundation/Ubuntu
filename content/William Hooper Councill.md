William Hooper Councill (1848-1909) was a former slave who became an influential educator, lawyer, minister, newspaper editor, and politician in Alabama. Some key facts about his life and accomplishments:

## Personal Life
Councill was born into slavery in Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1848. As a child, he was sold to a slave trader and brought to Huntsville, Alabama, where he was enslaved on a cotton plantation. During the Civil War, he escaped to Union lines and later returned to Alabama to attend a school started by Quaker missionaries. [1][2]

In 1868, Councill married Elizabeth Bettie Hunt McFarland, though they later divorced. He had four children with his second wife, Maria H. Wheeden, whom he married in 1884. [2][4]

## Career
After attending school, Councill began teaching in 1867 and opened the Lincoln Normal School in Huntsville in 1868 to provide education for black children. [1][2] 

In 1875, Councill became the founder and first president of the State Colored Normal School, which later became Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU), the state's first historically black land-grant college. He served as president of AAMU until his death in 1909. [1][2][3]

Councill was also an ordained minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and founded St. John A.M.E. Church in Huntsville in 1885. He was the founder and editor of the Huntsville Herald newspaper from 1877 to 1884. [2][4]

## Achievements
Councill was a pioneering advocate for African American education in Alabama. He used his political connections to secure funding and approval for the State Colored Normal School. He was the first African American admitted to the Alabama bar in 1883, though he never practiced law. [1][2][4]

The first public school for African Americans in Huntsville was named William Hooper Councill High School in his honor. The school closed during integration in 1966, but its legacy is commemorated by the William Hooper Councill Memorial Park opened in 2021. [3]
