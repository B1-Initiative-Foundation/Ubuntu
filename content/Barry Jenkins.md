## Personal Life
Barry Jenkins was born in 1979 at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, the youngest of four siblings from different fathers. His father separated from his mother while she was pregnant, believing he was not the father. Jenkins was primarily raised by another older woman, as his mother suffered from a crack-cocaine addiction and was a teenage runaway who abandoned him. Jenkins grew up in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami and attended Miami Northwestern Senior High School, where he played football and ran track. [2]

## Career
Jenkins studied film at the Florida State University College of Motion Picture Arts, where he met many of his future frequent collaborators. After graduating, he moved to Los Angeles and worked as a production assistant for two years before becoming disillusioned with "Hollywood filmmaking."[2]

Jenkins made his filmmaking debut with the 2003 short film "My Josephine," which explored the romantic life of a young Arabic-speaking man following 9/11. He then directed several other short films, including "Little Brown Boy" and "Medicine for Melancholy" (2008), his first feature film. "Medicine for Melancholy" was hailed by The New York Times as one of the best films of the year and depicted the flirtations between a young African American couple against the backdrop of a gentrified San Francisco. [2][3]

After an eight-year hiatus from feature filmmaking, Jenkins directed and co-wrote the critically acclaimed independent drama "Moonlight" in 2016, which won numerous accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. Jenkins received an Oscar nomination for Best Director and jointly won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. [1][2]

Jenkins went on to direct the 2018 film "If Beale Street Could Talk," an adaptation of the James Baldwin novel, which earned him further acclaim and award nominations. In 2021, he created and directed the Amazon Video limited series "The Underground Railroad" based on the novel of the same name by Colson Whitehead, for which he won a Peabody Award. [2][4]
