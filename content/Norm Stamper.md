Norm Stamper is an American former chief of police, writer, law enforcement consultant, and advocate for criminal justice reform. He served as the Chief of the Seattle Police Department from 1994 to 2000, during which time he was responsible for the department's response to the protests of the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999. Stamper has expressed regret about his decisions during that event[1][2][3][4]. 

Stamper was a police officer for 34 years, the first 28 in San Diego before moving to Seattle[5]. He has a doctorate in Leadership and Human Behavior from San Diego State University[5]. Since his resignation, Stamper has called for the legalization of all drugs and the case-by-case release of persons incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses[5]. He serves as an advisory board member for organizations such as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws[5]. Stamper is also committed to eradicating domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual assault, and has served on the Constitution Project's Death Penalty Committee and Death Penalty Focus[5].

Stamper is the author of several books, including "Breaking Rank: A Top Cop's Expos√© of the Dark Side of American Policing" and "To Protect and Serve: How to Fix America's Police"[2][3][5]. He has also appeared on numerous national television and radio programs, and has written articles and op-eds for various publications[5].
