Haywood Patterson was at the center of the Scottsboro case, as he was viewed as the most guilty and defiant of the accused boys. He was convicted four times between 1931 and 1937, and spent much of his adult life in Alabama prisons. Despite the Supreme Court overturning his death sentences, Patterson was ultimately sentenced to 75 years in prison. He escaped from prison in 1948 and fled to Detroit, where he wrote a book about his experiences called "Scottsboro Boy" with the help of journalist Earl Conrad. Patterson died of cancer in a Michigan prison in 1952 at the age of 39, after being convicted of a separate manslaughter charge in Detroit. The Scottsboro case highlighted the racial injustice and discrimination faced by African Americans in the Jim Crow-era South.[1][3][4]

## Personal Life
Patterson was born in Georgia in 1912 and was the son of a sharecropper. He left school after the third grade and began working odd jobs, eventually becoming a veteran of riding the rails and looking for work across the country. [1]

## Career
Patterson was 18 years old when he was arrested and charged with the rape of Victoria Price and Ruby Bates. He was tried four times between 1931 and 1937, receiving the death sentence three times before being sentenced to 75 years in prison. [1][2] Patterson spent the next 16 years in Alabama courtrooms and prisons, becoming recognized as the "most loyal, most militant, and most spirited of the Scottsboro Boys."[1]

## Achievements
Patterson's story was later told in the book "Scottsboro Boy," which he co-authored. He was also portrayed by Joshua Henry in the original Broadway cast of the musical "The Scottsboro Boys."[2] In 2013, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles posthumously pardoned Patterson, along with two other Scottsboro Boys. [2]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
The case of the Scottsboro Boys was a major example of racial injustice in the American justice system. Despite the lack of evidence against them, the young men were convicted by all-white juries due to the pervasive racism and prejudice of the time. [3] Patterson and the other Scottsboro Boys were subjected to repeated trials, convictions, and imprisonment for a crime they did not commit. [1][3]
