Lemuel Haynes was the first African-American ordained as a minister in the United States, and the first to receive an honorary master's degree from Middlebury College in 1804.[2][3] He was a Puritan theologian, patriot, and abolitionist who served as a pastor of a white congregation in Vermont for over 40 years.[1][3] Haynes was abandoned by his parents at a young age and raised by the Rose family, who treated him as one of their own children and instilled in him a deep Christian faith.[1][3] He was greatly influenced by the works of Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and Philip Doddridge, and adopted a Calvinist theology.[1][3] Haynes served in the Continental Army during the American Revolution and was a staunch supporter of the Federalist Party and George Washington.[1][3][4] Despite facing racial prejudice, Haynes became a respected and influential preacher, known for his biblical exposition and commitment to truth.[1][3][4]

Based on the search results provided, here is a concise answer to the question:

Lemuel Haynes was the first African American to receive an honorary college degree when Middlebury College awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1804. [2][3]

The search results indicate that this was only the fourth degree ever given by Middlebury College, and the first ever awarded to an African American. This honor recognized Haynes' accomplishments as a prominent New England Congregational minister and his contributions to religious thought and writing. [2][3]

Isaiah G. DeGrasse was one of the earliest known Black graduates of a flagship state university in the United States. [1][2]

## Personal Life
DeGrasse was born in 1813 in New York City to a successful and upwardly mobile family. [1] He began his college studies at Geneva College (now Hobart and William Smith Colleges) before transferring to Newark College (now the University of Delaware) in 1836. [1]

## Career
In 1836, DeGrasse graduated from Newark College, becoming one of the earliest Black graduates of what would become a flagship state university. [1][2] His graduation was not publicly celebrated at the time, as it could have incited violence in the slave state of Delaware. [1] After graduating, DeGrasse was ordained as a deacon in the Protestant Episcopal Church and worked to expand educational opportunities for Black students on Long Island. [1] He later left the United States for Jamaica, where he intended to work as a missionary, but passed away from yellow fever shortly after his arrival in 1841 at the age of 27. [1]

## Achievements
DeGrasse's graduation from Newark College in 1836 was a significant milestone, as he was one of the earliest known Black students to graduate from a flagship state university in the United States. [1][2] His accomplishment was largely forgotten for over a century until it was rediscovered by scholars and staff at the University of Delaware. [1]
