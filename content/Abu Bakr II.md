Abu Bakr II, also known as Mansa Abu Bakr II, was a 14th-century ruler of the Mali Empire in West Africa. He is known for his legendary voyage to explore the Atlantic Ocean, which is mentioned in the work of Syrian historian al-Umari, who met Mansa Musa (Abu Bakr II's immediate successor) in Cairo. According to the account, Abu Bakr II equipped 200 ships filled with men and the same number equipped with gold, water, and provisions, enough to last them for years. The ships departed, and a long time passed before anyone returned. One ship came back, and the captain reported that they had traveled for a long time until there appeared in the open sea a river with a powerful current. The other ships went on, but when they reached that place, they did not return and no more was seen of them. Abu Bakr II then prepared 2,000 ships, 1,000 for himself and the men he took with him, and 1,000 for water and provisions. He left his empire in the hands of deputies and embarked on the Atlantic Ocean with his men, but he and his fleet were never heard from again[1].

The search results do not provide any information about Abu Bakr II's life before his legendary voyage or his achievements during his reign. However, it is mentioned that the Mali Empire, under his rule, had reached its pinnacle, and the wealth of the empire can be seen in the famous pilgrimage of Mansa Musa (Abu Bakr II's immediate successor) to Mecca, where he spent so much gold that the rate of the gold dinar fell by six silver dirhams. The empire's peace and stability may have allowed a rather bizarre episode in Abu Bakr's reign to take place, where he abdicated his throne to explore the Atlantic Ocean[1].

The search results also do not provide any information about Abu Bakr II's legacy or his impact on the Mali Empire or the world. However, it is mentioned that the colonization efforts would be significantly slower if Abu Bakr II had reached the Americas 200 years sooner, which could have had significant historical implications[3].

## The Legend of Mansa Abu Bakr II's Voyage to the Atlantic Ocean

According to the search results, Mansa (meaning "king", "emperor" or "sultan") Abu Bakr II was a 14th century ruler of the Mali Empire in West Africa. The Mali Empire had reached its pinnacle during this time, as evidenced by the famous pilgrimage of Mansa Musa (Abu Bakr II's immediate successor) to Mecca, where he spent so much gold that it caused the value of the gold dinar to fall[1].

The search results describe a rather bizarre episode in Abu Bakr II's reign - the Malian ruler reportedly abdicated his throne so that he could explore the Atlantic Ocean[1][2][3][4][5]. According to the Syrian historian al-Umari, who met Mansa Musa in Cairo, Abu Bakr II organized a massive expedition of over 2,000 ships to sail westward across the Atlantic[4][5].

However, the search results note that the evidence for Abu Bakr II actually reaching the Americas is "unconvincing at best, and non-existent at worst"[1][2][3]. The expedition failed, and only one of the hundreds of ships that set out returned, claiming the others had perished in a whirlpool. Abu Bakr II did not believe this account and is said to have embarked on a second expedition himself, never to be heard from again[2].

While the tale of Abu Bakr II's abdication and exploration of the Atlantic Ocean is a "fantastic one", the search results suggest it is unlikely that the Malian ruler actually reached the New World during his expedition[1][3]. The legend remains an intriguing part of West African history, but the current evidence does not support the claim that Abu Bakr II discovered America before Christopher Columbus[1][2][3].
