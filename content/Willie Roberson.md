Roberson was one of the nine young African American men, known as the "Scottsboro Boys", who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in [[Scottsboro]], [[Alabama]] in 1931[1][2]. Roberson, who was 16 years old at the time, was headed to [[Memphis]] to seek treatment for his syphilis and gonorrhea when he was arrested[1][2]. Despite evidence that Roberson was physically incapable of committing the alleged crime, he was convicted and sentenced to death along with the other Scottsboro Boys[1][2]. Roberson was not treated for his sexually transmitted diseases until 1933, while in prison[1]. After six years in prison, the charges against Roberson were finally dismissed in 1937[2]. Upon his release, Roberson briefly pursued a career in show business before settling into steady work in [[New York City]]. However, he continued to suffer from poor health, including asthma attacks, and died at an unknown date[1][3].

Based on the search results, here is a summary of the key information about Willie Roberson, one of the Scottsboro Boys:

Willie Roberson was 15 years old when he was falsely accused of raping Ruby Bates aboard a freight train in 1931. At the time, Roberson was suffering from a serious case of syphilis, with sores all over his genitals, which would have made intercourse very painful. Additionally, Roberson was unable to walk without a cane and clearly was in no condition to leap from railroad car to railroad car, as his accusers alleged. 

Despite these facts, Roberson was prosecuted and convicted on the strength of the allegations made by Bates and her co-accuser Victoria Price. The prosecution even suggested that the syphilis Bates contracted in 1931 was caused by Roberson having had sex with her, which was clearly false[1][2][3].

Roberson maintained his innocence throughout the multiple trials. Finally, even the prosecutors came to believe him, and Roberson was one of four Scottsboro Boys released in July 1937 after spending six years in jail[1][2]. After his release, Roberson lived in New York City where he found steady work[2].

The search results indicate that Roberson suffered greatly during his time in prison, as he suffered from asthma and the lack of fresh air aggravated his condition. He was also diagnosed with "prison neurosis" and at one point said "If I don't get free I just rather they give me the electric chair and be dead out of my misery"[2].
