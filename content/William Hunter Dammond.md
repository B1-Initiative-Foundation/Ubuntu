William Hunter Dammond was the first African American to graduate with a civil engineering degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1893.[1][3] He went on to become a pioneering inventor, best known for his work on train signaling systems that enhanced rail safety.[1][2][3]

Dammond's most significant invention was a patented "Signaling System" in 1903, which used an alternating-track, circuit-based technology to replace the error-prone human hand signals used to direct trains.[1][2] This innovation reduced the prevalence of train accidents. By 1906, he had patented a "Clear, Caution, Danger" mechanism to further improve his signaling system.[1] 

Beyond his technical achievements, Dammond was also an influential mentor and advocate for Black engineers. In 1970, he hosted the first meeting of the Northern California Council of Black Professional Engineers at his home, which continues to promote diversity and professional development in the field.[1]

Dammond's groundbreaking work as both an inventor and a leader made him a highly respected figure in the engineering community. He is celebrated as a trailblazer who paved the way for future generations of Black engineers.[1][2][5]

William Hunter Dammond was an African American civil engineer who made significant contributions to railroad safety and engineering.

## Personal Life
Dammond was born in 1873 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended the Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh) and graduated in 1893 as the first African American to do so. After graduating, he struggled to find employment as an engineer due to racial discrimination. [1][2]

Dammond later married a school teacher named Sarah Mabel Mofford in 1900. [1] He had one son, though he became estranged from him later in life. [1][4]

## Career
After graduating, Dammond worked a variety of jobs including as a clerk, sewer contractor, and printer before finding work as a math professor at Paul Quinn College in Texas in 1897 and then Wilberforce University in Ohio in 1899. [1][2]

Dammond's passion, however, was engineering. In 1903, he patented an electric track circuit signaling system called the "Dammond Circuit" that represented an improvement over manually operated block signals. This system used alternating current with a battery backup to provide audio and visual signals to train operators, improving railroad safety. [2][3][4]

Dammond continued to develop and promote his signaling inventions, taking them to London in 1910 to explore the market. During World War I, he worked as a bridge designer in England. After returning to the US in 1916, he worked as a draftsman for US Steel and Boston Structural Steel. In the 1920s, he moved to New York City and worked as a structural draftsman for the New York City Board of Transportation. [1][2][3]

## Achievements
Dammond was the first African American to graduate from the University of Pittsburgh in 1893. [1][2] His Dammond Circuit signaling system was adopted by numerous railroads along the East Coast, including the Long Island Rail Road, Pennsylvania Railroad, and New York City Subway. [3][4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Despite the widespread use of his patented inventions, Dammond struggled to receive recognition and compensation for his work throughout his life due to racial discrimination. [4][5] He died in 1956 as a pauper in New York City. [1]

## Bibliography
Dammond did not author any books, but he did publish several technical articles and letters related to his railroad signaling inventions. [4]
