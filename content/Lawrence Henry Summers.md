## Career

Summers then held several senior policy positions in the U.S. government, including Under Secretary for International Affairs of the U.S. Department of the Treasury from 1993 to 1995, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury from 1995 to 1999, and 71st Secretary of the Treasury from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton.[4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Summers resigned as President of Harvard in 2006 following a no-confidence vote by Harvard faculty, which resulted in large part from Summers's conflict with Cornel West, financial conflict of interest questions regarding his relationship with Andrei Shleifer, and a 2005 speech in which he offered three reasons for the under-representation of women in science and engineering, including the possibility that there exists a "different availability of aptitude at the high end".[4]
