The F.W. Woolworth Company was a retail company founded by Frank Winfield Woolworth in 1879. It was one of the most successful American and international five-and-dime businesses, setting trends and creating the modern retail model that stores follow worldwide today.[1][2][3][4]

Woolworth pioneered new retail practices such as self-serve stores, where customers could browse and pick up items themselves instead of relying on clerks.[3][4] He expanded the business rapidly, opening multiple locations across the United States and later internationally.[2][3] At its peak, the Woolworth's brand was considered as British as "fish and chips" in the UK and the "five-and-ten" in the US.[2]

However, the company struggled to adapt to changing consumer preferences and competition in the later 20th century, leading to its decline and eventual closure of its department stores in the 1990s.[1] The Woolworth brand and some of its subsidiaries continue to operate in various forms today.[2]

In 1879, Woolworth opened his first successful "Woolworth's Great Five Cent Store" in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with the help of his brother Charles Sumner Woolworth.[1][2] The two brothers pioneered many modern retail practices like direct purchasing, merchandising, and customer service.[2]
