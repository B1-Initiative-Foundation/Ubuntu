Henry Lowry was an African-American tenant farmer in Mississippi County, Arkansas. On Christmas Day 1920, Lowry got into a dispute with local planter O.T. Craig over a payment issue. This led to a confrontation where Lowry killed Craig and his adult daughter. Lowry then fled to El Paso, Texas, but was eventually captured and extradited back to Arkansas. [1][3]

A mob of white vigilantes then seized Lowry from the officers transporting him, took him to Nodena, Arkansas, and lynched him by chaining him to a log, placing leaves soaked in gasoline around his feet, and burning him alive in front of a crowd of at least 500 people. [3]

The brutal lynching of Henry Lowry gained national and international attention at a time when the U.S. Congress was debating anti-lynching legislation, though the legislation ultimately failed to pass. Lowry's murder was used in a campaign to raise awareness about lynching in the United States. [3]
