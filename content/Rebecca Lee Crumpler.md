## Personal Life
Rebecca Lee Crumpler was born Rebecca Davis in 1831 in Christiana, Delaware to Absolum Davis and Matilda Webber. She was raised by her aunt in Pennsylvania, who frequently cared for sick neighbors, inspiring Crumpler's interest in medicine.[1][4] In 1852, Crumpler moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts and began working as a nurse, assisting several doctors for eight years.[4] In 1852, she married Wyatt Lee, a Virginia laborer, but he died of tuberculosis in 1863.[4] In 1865, Crumpler married Arthur Crumpler, a formerly enslaved man who had escaped bondage from Virginia.[4]

## Career
