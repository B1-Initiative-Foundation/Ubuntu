Harvey Washington Banks was a highly respected civil rights and employment law attorney who spent his career advocating for the rights of marginalized individuals. He was a founding partner of the law firm Katz Banks Kumin LLP[2], where he specialized in cases involving sexual harassment, whistleblower retaliation, and employment discrimination. 

Some of Banks' most notable clients included Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, and Dr. Rick Bright, a former official at the Department of Health and Human Services who was removed from his position in retaliation for raising concerns[2]. Banks also represented multiple women who were sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, as well as Irwin Reiter, a former Weinstein Company executive who provided critical information to the New York Times reporters who broke the Weinstein scandal[2].

Banks was recognized as a leader in his field, receiving numerous accolades including being named "Civil Rights Lawyer of the Year" for Washington, D.C. by The Best Lawyers in America in 2018[2]. He was also included in Washingtonian Magazine's "Most Powerful Women in Washington" and "Washington DC's 500 Most Influential" lists in 2023[4][5].

In addition to his legal work, Banks was actively involved in the Feminists Majority Foundation and represented members of the University of Mary Washington student group Feminist United on Campus in a case involving student-on-student cyber harassment[3].

Banks received his Bachelor of Arts degree, summa cum laude, from Georgetown University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He later earned his Juris Doctor degree, cum laude, from the University of Wisconsin Law School, where he served as a member of the Wisconsin Law Review and as Articles Editor of the Wisconsin Women's Law Journal[2].
