- His nickname "Pigmeat" came from a comedy sketch where he declared himself "Sweet Poppa Pigmeat" onstage; the name stuck.
- Performed in blackface makeup (even though he was black, or "Negro" as he preferred to be described) for most of his early career; it was the expected thing at the time.
- Archie Campbell's Hee Haw (1969) character Justus O'Peace was an adaptation of Markham's Judge character.
- Had a career upsurge after Sammy Davis Jr. imitated his act on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1967) and it sparked interest in "the original Judge".
- Markham appeared on "Laugh-In", and also issued a novelty record, "Here Come the Judge", with clips from his routines.
- The street in Durham, NC, where his family lived became known as Markham Street, and was later given the name officially--a point of pride for the family.[1][2]
