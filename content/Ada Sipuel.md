Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher was a key figure in the Civil Rights Movement in Oklahoma. In 1946, she applied for admission to the [[University of Oklahoma]] law school and was denied due to her race. This led to the landmark Supreme Court case Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., in which the court ruled unanimously that the state of Oklahoma must provide equal instruction for Black students. [1][2][3][4] 

After further legal battles, Fisher was finally admitted to the [[University of Oklahoma]] law school in 1949, becoming the first African American student to attend an all-white law school in the South. [1][2][4] She went on to earn her law degree in 1951 and had a distinguished career as a lawyer, educator, and civil rights activist. [1][2][4]
