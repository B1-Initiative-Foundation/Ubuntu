## Personal Life
Carl Jung was born on July 26, 1875 in Kesswil, Switzerland as the first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung, a Protestant minister, and Emilie Preiswerk.[2][3][4] His childhood was marked by the complexities of his parents - his father's failing belief in religion and his mother's mental illness, which led her to be hospitalized for a time.[3][4] Despite the expectations that he would follow in his father's footsteps and enter the clergy, Jung instead pursued a path in medicine and psychology.[3][4]

Jung married Emma Rauschenbach in 1903 and they had five children together. The couple remained married until Emma's death in 1955.[4]

## Career
After graduating from the University of Basel in 1900 and obtaining his M.D. from the University of Zurich in 1902, Jung began working at the Burgholzli Asylum.[3][4] There, he came under the guidance of Eugene Bleuler, a pioneering psychologist, and developed the concept of the "complex" to describe emotional associations in the subconscious.[3][4] 

Jung's growing reputation led him to collaborate with Sigmund Freud for about six years starting in 1907. However, their differing viewpoints and temperaments eventually led to the end of their collaboration.[3][4]

Jung went on to found analytical psychology, advancing ideas such as introvert and extrovert personalities, archetypes, and the power of the unconscious.[2][3][4] He was a prolific writer and published numerous influential works during his lifetime.

## Achievements
Jung received many honors and awards over the course of his career, including honorary doctorates from Clark University, Fordham University, Harvard University, the University of Allahabad, the University of Benares, the University of Calcutta, the University of Oxford, and the University of Geneva.[3]

He was named an honorary member of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences in 1944.[4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
There has been some debate and disagreement among biographers and critics about the nature of Jung's experiences during the period from 1913 to 1917, when he engaged in the creative activity that produced his work "Liber Novus". Some have characterized this as a "creative illness", a psychotic breakdown, or a period of madness, while Jung himself described it as a "voluntary confrontation with the unconscious".[1]

Additionally, Jung's grandson entertained the idea that Jung might be descended from the German romantic writer Goethe, but there is no evidence to support this claim.[5]

## Bibliography
Jung was a prolific writer and published numerous influential works during his lifetime, including:

- "Liber Novus" (also known as "The Red Book")
- "Approaching the Unconscious" (published posthumously in 1964)
