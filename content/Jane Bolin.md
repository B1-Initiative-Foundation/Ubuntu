Here is a concise biography of Jane Bolin, the first Black woman to become a judge in the United States:

## Personal Life
Jane Matilda Bolin was born on April 11, 1908 in Poughkeepsie, New York to Gaius C. Bolin, a renowned Black lawyer who was the first Black graduate of Williams College, and Matilda Ingram Emery, an immigrant from the British Isles.[1][2][3] As the child of an interracial couple, Bolin faced discrimination growing up in Poughkeepsie.[5] Her mother passed away when Bolin was 8 years old, and her father raised her while running his law practice.[1][3]

Bolin attended Wellesley College, where she was one of only two Black students in her class, and graduated as a Wellesley scholar in 1928.[1][3] She then became the first Black woman to graduate from Yale Law School in 1931.[1][2][3][4] In 1933, Bolin married attorney Ralph E. Mizelle, who later became a member of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Black Cabinet before passing away in 1943.[1][2] Bolin later remarried to Walter P. Offutt, Jr., a minister, in 1974.[5]

## Career
After graduating from Yale, Bolin briefly practiced law with her father in Poughkeepsie before moving to New York City.[1][2][3] In 1936, she ran unsuccessfully for the New York State Assembly as a Republican candidate.[1][5] 

In 1939, at the age of 31, Bolin made history when she was appointed by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia as a judge of the New York City Domestic Relations Court, becoming the first Black woman to serve as a judge in the United States.[1][2][3][4] She remained a judge on the court, later renamed the Family Court, for the next 40 years, being reappointed three times.[1][2][5]

As a judge, Bolin worked to eliminate discriminatory practices, such as assigning probation officers based on race, and ensuring that publicly funded child welfare agencies accepted children regardless of their ethnic background.[1][4] She was a tireless advocate for children's rights and education.[1][2][5]

## Achievements
Bolin was the first Black woman to graduate from Yale Law School, the first to join the New York City Bar Association, and the first to join the New York City Law Department.[1][2][3][4] She received honorary degrees from several institutions, including Tuskegee Institute, Williams College, and Morgan State University.[5]

Bolin served on the boards of the NAACP, the National Urban League, the City-Wide Citizens' Committee on Harlem, and the Child Welfare League.[1][5] She was a legal advisor to the National Council of Negro Women and remained active in the Civil Rights Movement.[5]
