Elizabeth Eckford is an American civil rights activist and one of the [[Little Rock Nine]], a group of African American students who, in 1957, were the first black students to attend the previously all-white [[Little Rock Central High School]] in [[Arkansas]] following the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in [[Brown v. Board of Education]]. [1][4]

On September 4, 1957, Eckford, then 15 years old, attempted to enter Central High School alone, as the rest of the [[Little Rock Nine]] were unable to meet at the planned location. She was met by an angry mob of white segregationists and turned away by the Arkansas National Guard, who were under orders from Governor [[Orval Faubus]] to prevent the school's integration. [1][3]

Eckford's ordeal was captured in a now-iconic photograph by [[Will Counts]] of the [[Arkansas Democrat]], which showed her being followed and threatened by the mob. This image brought international attention to the crisis in Little Rock and prompted President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to send federal troops to escort the [[Little Rock Nine]] to school. [2][4]

Eckford endured a year of harassment and abuse at Central High, but she and the other [[Little Rock Nine]] students persevered, with Eckford completing the year and [[Ernest Green]] becoming the first African American to graduate from the school. [3]

After leaving Central High, Eckford served in the U.S. Army for five years and has held various jobs, including as a waitress, history teacher, welfare worker, and probation officer. She has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder due to her experiences during the integration of Central High. [1][4]

In 2022, Eckford and other members of the [[Little Rock Nine]] were honored at the keel-laying ceremony of the attack submarine USS [[Arkansas]] (SSN-800), where they etched their initials onto metal plates that will be affixed to the submarine throughout its life. [4]

Elizabeth Eckford was one of the nine African American students who desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957. [1][3]

## Personal Life
Elizabeth Eckford was born on October 4, 1941 in Little Rock, Arkansas. She was one of six children born to Oscar and Birdie Eckford. Her father worked nights as a dining car maintenance worker for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and her mother taught at the segregated state school for blind and deaf children. [1]

## Career
On September 4, 1957, the 15-year-old Eckford was the first of the Little Rock Nine to arrive at Central High School, alone, after the meeting place with the other students was changed the previous night. [1][3] She was blocked from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard, on orders from Governor Orval Faubus, and faced an angry, segregationist mob. [1][3] This moment was captured in an iconic photograph that brought international attention to the crisis. [1][3] 

Due to the closure of all of Little Rock's high schools the following year, Eckford did not graduate from Central High. However, she took correspondence and night courses and had enough credits to be accepted by Knox College in Illinois, though she soon returned to Little Rock to be closer to her parents. She later attended Central State University in Ohio and earned a BA in history. [1]

Eckford served in the U.S. Army for five years, first as a pay clerk and then as an information specialist and military reporter. She has held various other jobs throughout her life, including as a waitress, history teacher, welfare worker, unemployment and employment interviewer, and probation officer in Little Rock. [1]

## Achievements
Eckford was awarded the prestigious Spingarn Medal by the NAACP in 1958, along with the rest of the Little Rock Nine and Daisy Bates. [1] In 2018, she returned to Knox College to receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree "in recognition of the courage she exhibited as one of the Little Rock Nine, of her enduring legacy as an icon of the American Civil Rights Movement, and of her inspiration as a role model for past, current, and future human rights activists."[2]
