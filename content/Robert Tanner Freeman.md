Robert Tanner Freeman was born into slavery in 1846 in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[District of Columbia]], [[United States]]. [1][4] As a child, he befriended a local white dentist named [[Henry Bliss Noble]] and began working as his apprentice. [1][4] Despite being rejected by two medical schools, Freeman was eventually accepted into the newly opened [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]] in 1867 at the age of 21, after a dean petitioned the school to end its history of exclusion against people of color. [1][2][4][5] In 1869, Freeman graduated alongside his classmate [[George Franklin Grant]], becoming the first African-American dentists in the United States. [1][2][3][4][5] 

After graduation, Freeman returned to [[Washington, D.C.]] and opened his own dental practice, where he became known for his commitment to mentoring other young African-Americans interested in the medical field. [1][3][4] Tragically, Freeman's life was cut short in 1873 when he died of a water-borne illness at the age of 27. [1][4] 

Despite his untimely death, Freeman's legacy lives on. He was honored by the [[National Dental Association]], whose predecessor organization was even named the [[Robert T. Freeman Dental Society]] in his honor. [3][4] Freeman's grandson, [[Robert C. Weaver]], also made history as the first African-American to serve in a Presidential cabinet, appointed as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development by [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] in 1966. [4]

Robert Tanner Freeman was the first African-American to receive a degree in dentistry from an academic institution. [1][2]

## Personal Life
Freeman was born around 1846 in Washington, D.C. to former slaves who had bought their freedom. [4] He trained under Dr. Henry Bliss Noble, a white dentist, who encouraged him to formally train for a dental career. [1][4]

## Career
Freeman applied to two dental schools but was rejected on racial grounds. He then applied to the newly established Harvard Dental School in 1868 and was one of the first six students to receive the Doctor of Dental Medicine degree in 1869, becoming the first African-American to graduate from a U.S. dental school. [1][2][4] 

After graduation, Freeman moved to Washington, D.C. and practiced dentistry until his death on June 14, 1873. [1][2] The Washington Society of Colored Dentists later renamed itself the Robert Tanner Freeman Dental Society in his honor. [1][2]

## Achievements
Freeman's graduation from Harvard was a significant milestone, as he paved the way for future generations of African-American dentists by breaking racial barriers in a profession that had been exclusively white. [3] His story inspired others to pursue careers in dentistry and medicine, contributing to the gradual diversification of the healthcare field. [3]
