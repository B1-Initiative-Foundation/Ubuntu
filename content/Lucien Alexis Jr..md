Lucien Alexis Jr. was the son of renowned educator Lucien Alexis Sr., the principal of McDonogh #35 High School in New Orleans. [1] Lucien Jr. was accepted into Harvard University at the young age of 14, but first attended Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, the same school his father had attended. [1] 

At Harvard, Lucien Jr. struggled academically and was described as having "mediocre ability" and an "inferiority complex" in the sea of white faces. [1] He was the only black player on Harvard's lacrosse team in 1941. [2] When the Harvard lacrosse team was scheduled to play against the Naval Academy, the superintendent refused to allow Lucien Jr. to participate due to racial segregation policies. [2] Lucien Jr. voluntarily left the game, and Harvard ended up forfeiting the match. [2]

After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1947, Lucien Jr. returned to New Orleans and became the head of a small business school for black students called Straight Business. [1] He married Rochelle Nash and had four children, including daughter Lurita Alexis Doan, who later became an entrepreneur and the first woman and second African American to serve as Administrator of the General Services Administration.
