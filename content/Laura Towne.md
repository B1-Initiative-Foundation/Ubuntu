Laura Matilda Towne was an American abolitionist and educator. She is best known for forming the first freedmen's schools, notably the Penn School, on St. Helena Island, South Carolina after the Union captured the Sea Islands during the Civil War. [1][2]

Towne was raised in Philadelphia, where she heard sermons on the abolition of slavery by her minister, [[William Henry Furness]], at the First Unitarian Church. Influenced by these teachings, she answered the call for volunteers when the Union captured Port Royal and other Sea Islands in 1861. [5]

In 1862, Towne and her friend [[Ellen Murray]] founded the Penn School, one of the first schools for newly freed slaves in the United States. Over the next 40 years, they ministered to the freed slaves, developing their trust, providing medical care, teaching them to read and write, and fighting for their land rights. [1][2]

Towne and Murray eventually adopted several African American children and raised them as their own. Towne spent the rest of her life running the Penn School, which became the Penn Normal, Industrial, and Agricultural School after her death. The school trained generations of students, including U.S. Congressman [[Robert Smalls]], and served as a training ground for the Civil Rights movement. [1][2][4]

Laura Matilda Towne was an American educator and abolitionist who founded one of the earliest and most successful freedmen's schools for former slaves after the American Civil War. [1][2][3][4]

## Personal Life
Towne was born on May 3, 1825 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She was raised in Philadelphia and was influenced by the abolitionist sermons of her minister, William Henry Furness, at the First Unitarian Church. [1][2][3][4]

## Career
Towne studied homeopathic medicine privately and may have attended the Penn Medical University, though there is no record of her receiving a degree. [2][4] In the 1850s and 1860s, she taught in charity schools in various northern towns and cities. [3] 

In 1862, Towne responded to a call for volunteers to teach, nurse, and assist the large population of former slaves liberated in the Union capture of the South Carolina Sea Islands. She arrived on St. Helena Island and within a short time began teaching school, practicing medicine, and helping to distribute clothing and other goods. [1][3][4]

In September 1862, Towne and her friend Ellen Murray established the Penn School, one of the earliest freedmen's schools. They ran the school for the next 40 years, offering a rigorous curriculum modeled on New England schools. The Penn School was the only secondary education institution available to African Americans on the Sea Islands. [1][2][3][4]

## Achievements
Towne played a major role in helping the Sea Islanders become owners of the plantations on which they had been slaves. She also served as an informal legal advisor, public health officer, and advocate for temperance and children's welfare. [1][4] 

The Penn School evolved to include teacher-training courses starting in 1870. After Towne's death in 1901, the school was renamed the Penn Normal, Industrial, and Agricultural School and began to embrace vocational training, which Towne had always resisted. In 1948, the school became part of the South Carolina public school system. [1][4]
