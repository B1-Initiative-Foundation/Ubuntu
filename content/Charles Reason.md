## Personal Life
Charles Lewis Reason was born on July 21, 1818 in New York City to West Indies immigrants Michiel and Elizabeth Reason.[1][2][4] He attended the African Free School along with his brothers Elmer and Patrick, who were also important historical figures.[2] Reason was married and widowed three times, though only the identity of his third wife, Clorice Esteve, is known.[1][4]

## Career
Reason began his teaching career at the age of 14, becoming an instructor at the African Free School and receiving a salary of $25 per year.[2] He used some of his earnings to hire tutors to improve his own education.[2] Reason later studied at McGrawville College in New York.[2] 

In 1849, Reason became the first African American to hold a professorship at a predominantly white American college when he was hired as a professor of belles lettres, Greek, Latin, and French, as well as an adjunct professor of mathematics, at New York Central College.[2][3][4] He was joined by two other African American scholars, George B. Vashon and William Allen, in 1850.[4]

Reason also served as the principal of the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia from 1852 to 1856.[4] He then returned to New York City, where he became an administrator of schools for the next 37 years.[4] One of his achievements was leading the fight in 1873 to end racial segregation in New York City's public schools.[4]

## Achievements
Reason was a prolific writer, contributing verse to the Colored American in the 1830s and leading the Phoenix Society in New York City in the 1840s.[1][3] He wrote several notable poems, including "Freedom", "The Spirit Voice", and "Silent Thoughts".[4]

Reason was also a political activist and abolitionist. He played a prominent role in the Negro Convention Movement in New York, co-authoring the Call for the New York Negro Convention of 1840.[4] During the Civil War, he served on New York City's Citizen's Civil Rights Committee, which lobbied the state legislature for expanded Black civil rights.[3] After the war, he was vice president of the New York State Labor Union.[3]
