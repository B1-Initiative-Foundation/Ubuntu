Jehudi Ashmun was a graduate of [[Middlebury College]] and became an agent of the [[American Colonization Society]] upon graduation. He played a crucial role in the early development of the Liberian colony, serving as the colonial agent and helping to establish a system of civil government there.[1][2] Ashmun faced challenges in the colony, including issues with the livelihood of the colonists, and his actions were investigated by the ACS agent [[Ralph Randolph Gurley]].[1] However, Gurley's investigation led to Ashmun being appointed as the official colonial agent for the ACS.[1] Ashmun would go on to organize the African Education Society in 1829 to train individuals of color destined for Africa.[1] Ashmun's contributions were significant in the early years of the Liberian colony.

## Personal Life
Jehudi Ashmun was born on April 21, 1794 in Champlain, New York.[1][2][3] He attended Middlebury College and the University of Vermont.[1][2] In 1818, Ashmun married and his wife accompanied him to Bangor, Maine where he took his first position as a minister.[2]

## Career
Ashmun was appointed as the first principal and one of the first two professors of the Bangor Theological Seminary in Maine, a position he held until 1827.[2] Interested in the work of the American Colonization Society (ACS), Ashmun founded the newspaper The African Intelligencer to write about their mission of "repatriating" free blacks to a newly founded colony in West Africa.[2] This led to Ashmun being appointed as the representative of the U.S. government to the colony of Liberia in 1822 at the age of 26.[1][2] As the U.S. agent and de facto governor of Liberia from 1822 to 1828, Ashmun helped build the colony's defenses, increase agricultural production, annex more land, and develop trade.[1][2] He also played a key role in drafting Liberia's constitution that enabled African Americans to hold government positions.[1][2]

## Achievements
Ashmun's work laid the foundation for the establishment of the Republic of Liberia, which declared independence from the U.S. in 1847.[3] Liberia remained independent while most of Africa was conquered by European powers, making Ashmun's efforts a significant achievement.[3] Lincoln University in Pennsylvania was originally chartered in 1854 as Ashmun Institute in his honor.[2]
