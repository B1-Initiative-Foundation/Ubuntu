George Lewis Ruffin was a pioneering African American lawyer, politician, and judge in the late 19th century. Here is a summary of his life and accomplishments:

## Personal Life
Ruffin was born in 1834 in Richmond, Virginia to free Black parents. His family moved to Boston in 1853 in response to a Virginia law prohibiting free Blacks from learning to read and write. [1][2][3] In 1858, Ruffin married Josephine St. Pierre, an activist from a prominent Boston family. Together they had five children, including their daughter Florida Ruffin Ridley who became a school principal and co-founded the newspaper The Woman's Era. [2][3]

## Career
Ruffin supported his family as a barber while studying law on the side. In 1869, he became the first African American to graduate from Harvard Law School. [1][2][3][4] He was admitted to the Suffolk County Bar Association and practiced law successfully in Boston. [1][2]

Ruffin was politically active, serving as a delegate to the National Negro Convention in 1864 and 1872. [1][2] He was elected to the Massachusetts state legislature in 1870 as a Republican, and served two terms on the Boston City Council from 1875-1877, becoming the first African American elected to that body. [1][2][4]

In 1883, Ruffin was appointed by Governor Benjamin Butler as a judge on the Charlestown Municipal Court, making him the first African American judge in the United States. [1][2][3][4] That same year, he was also named consul resident for the Dominican Republic in Boston. [2][4]

## Achievements
Ruffin's pioneering achievements as the first African American graduate of Harvard Law School, the first African American elected to the Boston City Council, and the first African American judge in the United States were groundbreaking accomplishments that paved the way for greater racial integration and equality in the legal and political systems. [1][2][3][4]

In 1984, the George Lewis Ruffin Society was founded at Northeastern University to support minorities studying in the Massachusetts criminal justice system, in honor of Ruffin's legacy. [3][5]
