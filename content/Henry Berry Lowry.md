Henry Berry Lowry was an American outlaw and leader of the Lowry Gang, a group of Native Americans, African Americans, and one white member who fought against the Confederate Home Guard and the Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina during and after the Civil War. [1][3][4]

Lowry was born around 1845 in Robeson County, North Carolina to a successful mixed-race farming family. During the Civil War, he formed the Lowry Gang to help locals avoid conscription by the Confederacy. After the war, the gang continued to raid plantations and fight against white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan. [1][3][4]

Lowry became a legendary figure, with many considering him a Robin Hood-like hero who robbed from the powerful and gave to the poor. He evaded capture numerous times and mysteriously disappeared in 1872 after robbing a sheriff's office of $28,000. His death remains disputed, with some claiming he was killed and others believing he lived in hiding for years. [1][3][4]

The NAACP took an interest in Lowry's story, publishing a pamphlet about his lynching in 1921 and using it to highlight racial injustice in the South. [2]

Henry Berry Lowry was a Lumbee Native American outlaw and guerrilla leader who fought against the Confederate Home Guard and the Ku Klux Klan during and after the Civil War in Robeson County, North Carolina. [1][2][3]

## Personal Life
Lowry was born around 1845 to Allen and Mary (Cumbo) Lowry, a family of mixed Native American and Scottish ancestry. He was one of 12 children in the Lowry family, which had been large landholders but lost most of their property due to a series of lawsuits. [3]

During the Civil War, the Confederate government conscripted many local Native Americans, including some of Lowry's cousins, to work on the construction of Fort Fisher. Lowry initially formed his guerrilla band to help those hiding from this forced labor. [2][3]

## Career
In 1864, at the age of 18, Lowry killed two men - one who had accused him of stealing hogs, and a conscription officer who had mistreated women in Lowry's community. As a result, the Home Guard executed Lowry's father and brother. This led Lowry to become the leader of the Lowry gang, which consisted mainly of Black Native Americans, as well as a white youth named Zachariah McLaughlin and a Black man named George Applewhite. [1][2][3]

The Lowry gang conducted numerous robberies, often treating their victims respectfully and sometimes even returning stolen items. They were known for sharing their profits with the poor, such as distributing stolen corn. Lowry's activities made him a folk hero to the Indian, Black, and poor white populations of Robeson County. [1][2][3]

## Achievements
Lowry and his gang successfully evaded capture by the authorities for nearly a decade, despite a $12,000 bounty placed on Lowry by the Republican governor. They fought against the Ku Klux Klan and the Democratic White Supremacy movement during Reconstruction. [1][2][3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Lowry's death is disputed, with some reports claiming he accidentally shot himself in 1872 after robbing the local sheriff's office of $28,000, while others suggest he was seen alive several years later. His wife insisted until her death in 1909 that he had escaped. [1][2][3]
