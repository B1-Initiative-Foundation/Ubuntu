Clarence Everett Lightner was an American politician and mortician who served as the 30th Mayor of [[Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]] from 1973 to 1975. He was the first popularly elected African American mayor of a major Southern city in the United States. [1][3][5]

Lightner was born in [[Raleigh]] in 1921. He attended [[North Carolina Central College]] and played football, later serving in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he studied at the [[Echols College of Mortuary Science]] and took over his father's funeral home business in 1959. [1][3]

Lightner was elected to the [[Raleigh City Council]] in 1967 and served until 1973, when he launched a successful campaign for mayor. Despite African Americans comprising less than 16% of registered voters in Raleigh at the time, Lightner won the election with the support of the black community and white suburban residents. [1][3][5]

As mayor, Lightner oversaw the implementation of a mass transit system and strengthened floodplain construction regulations in the city. His tenure was largely uncontroversial. After serving one term, Lightner was appointed by [[North Carolina Governor]] [[Jim Hunt]] to the [[North Carolina Senate]] in 1977, where he served for about a year. [1][3]

Lightner was active in higher education, serving on the boards of trustees at [[Saint Augustine's College]] and his alma mater, [[North Carolina Central University]]. He was also the chair of the [[Southeast Raleigh Improvement Commission]] from 1993 to 2001. [3]

Lightner passed away in [[Raleigh]] in 2002 at the age of 80. He was survived by his wife, [[Marguerite Massey Lightner]], and three children. [1][3]

Clarence Everett Lightner was an American politician and mortician who served as the mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina from 1973 to 1975.[1][2] He was the first popularly elected mayor of Raleigh since 1947, and the first African American elected mayor of a mostly-white, major Southern city in the United States.[2]

## Personal Life
Lightner was born in 1921 in Raleigh, North Carolina.[2] He attended North Carolina Central College, where he played as a quarterback on the school football team.[2] After graduating, he enlisted in the United States Army and served on a tour of duty during World War II.[2] He subsequently enrolled in the Echols College of Mortuary Science, and in 1959 he assumed control of his father Calvin E. Lightner's funeral home.[2]

## Career
Lightner was elected to the Raleigh City Council in 1967.[2] During his council tenure he chaired a committee tasked with studying mass transit and for one term acted as Mayor pro tempore.[2] In 1973 he launched his candidacy for the office of Mayor. Backed by a coalition of blacks—who comprised less than 16% of all registered voters—and white suburban residents, Lightner won the November election, surprising observers and garnering national media attention.[1][2]
