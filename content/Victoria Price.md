The accusations made by Victoria Price and Ruby Bates led to one of the most protracted and tumultuous legal battles in American history, known as the Scottsboro case. Price was described as a "woman of the underworld" - a promiscuous, hard-drinking, and hard-swearing woman who supplemented her meager mill wages through prostitution.[1][3][5] 

Despite medical evidence that contradicted her claims of gang rape, Price's testimony was used to secure convictions of the Scottsboro Boys in multiple trials over the course of six years.[3] Prosecutors later expressed doubts about Price's veracity, but she refused to recant her accusations.[3] 

In 1976, Price emerged to file a defamation lawsuit against NBC after they portrayed her negatively in a television movie about the Scottsboro case. The case was eventually settled out of court.[2] Price died in 1982 without ever apologizing for her role in the injustice suffered by the Scottsboro Boys.[3]

Victoria Price was a key figure in the Scottsboro Boys case, a notorious legal case in the 1930s where nine young black men were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in Alabama. Here is a summary of Victoria Price's role and the key facts about her:

## Personal Life
Victoria Price was a 21-year-old white woman from Huntsville, Alabama at the time of the Scottsboro incident in 1931. She was described as a "lower class white woman" who was known to be promiscuous, hard-drinking, and to have a poor reputation in her community.[1][2] Price had been married three times by the age of 21.[2]

## Accusation and Trials
On March 25, 1931, Price and her friend Ruby Bates were riding a freight train when they encountered a group of nine young black men, who became known as the Scottsboro Boys. Price accused the nine men of gang-raping her and Bates on the train. This accusation led to the arrest of the Scottsboro Boys and a series of highly publicized trials over the next several years.[1][2][3]

## Controversy and Aftermath
Price's testimony was central to the prosecution's case against the Scottsboro Boys, despite significant doubts about her credibility. Defense lawyers attacked her reputation, describing her as a "common street prostitute" and presenting evidence that undermined her claims.[1][4] Bates later recanted her testimony, but Price never did.[3] 

The Scottsboro Boys case became a major civil rights issue, with the defendants eventually being cleared of the charges after years of legal battles. However, Price remained unrepentant about her role, stating in 1982 that if the Scottsboro Boys had been executed, "I'd push the button. I'd push it and laugh."[5] Price died in 1982 without ever apologizing for her actions.
