Atkins then attended Yale Law School, where he served as editor of the Yale Law Journal in 1920, the first Black person to do so. [1] He graduated cum laude with his LL.B. in 1922 and was elected to the Order of the Coif honor society, another first for a Black person. [1]

Atkins was instrumental in the founding of the Delta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi fraternity at Fisk, and later served as the first Basileus (president) of the Chi Chapter at Yale. [1] He was elected Grand Basileus (national president) of Omega Psi Phi in 1921, serving until 1924. [1] During his tenure, Atkins reorganized and expanded the fraternity in significant ways. [1]

After graduating from Yale, Atkins opened a law firm in Muskogee, Oklahoma with fellow Omega Psi Phi member Carter Walker Wesley.

[1] He argued the landmark civil rights case of Grovey v. Townsend in 1935, though the case resulted in defeat. [1]
