## Personal Life
Cromwell was born on November 27, 1919 in Washington, D.C. into a prominent African-American family. Her grandfather, John Wesley Cromwell, was a well-known civil rights activist and educator, and her father, John Wesley Cromwell Jr., was the city's first black certified public accountant. Her aunt, Otelia Cromwell, was the first black graduate of Smith College, and her cousin, Edward Brooke, was a Senator of Massachusetts and the first popularly elected Black State Attorney General. [1][2][3]

Cromwell graduated from Dunbar High School in 1936 and went on to earn an A.B. degree in sociology from Smith College in 1940, an M.A. degree in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1941, and a Ph.D. in sociology from Radcliffe College in 1946. [1][2][3]

She again broke the color line when she taught at Smith College in the late 1940s. In 1951, she joined the faculty at Boston University, where she taught sociology until 1985. [1][2][3]

In 1959, Cromwell co-founded Boston University's African Studies Center. From 1969 to 1985 she directed the African-American Studies program at the university. [1][2][3]
