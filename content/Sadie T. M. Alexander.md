Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander was a pioneering African American professional and civil rights activist of the early-to-mid-20th century. In 1921, she became the second African-American woman to receive a Ph.D. and the first one to receive one in economics in the United States. In 1927, she was the first Black woman to receive a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and went on to become the first African American woman to practice law in Pennsylvania.

She was the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, served on the President's Committee on Civil Rights, the Commission on Human Relations of the City of Philadelphia, and the board of the National Urban League for 25 years.
