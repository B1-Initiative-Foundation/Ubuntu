Sir [[William Arthur Lewis]] was a Saint Lucian economist and the James Madison Professor of Political Economy at [[Princeton University]]. He was known for his contributions in the field of economic development and was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1979 for his pioneering work on the economic development of less developed countries.[1][4] Lewis was the first black full professor at [[Princeton University]] when he arrived in 1963, and the first person of African descent to win a Nobel Prize in a field other than literature or peace.[1] His groundbreaking work on development economics, including his high-profile position as the chief economic adviser to [[Ghana]] in 1957, helped shape the field.[1][2][3]

Sir William Arthur Lewis was a Saint Lucian economist who made significant contributions to the field of economic development. Here is a summary of his life and work:

## Personal Life
Arthur Lewis was born in 1915 in St. Lucia, then part of the British Windward Islands. His parents were George Ferdinand and Ida Lewis, and he was the fourth of their five sons. After his father died when Arthur was 7 years old, his mother raised the family alone. Lewis was a gifted student and was promoted two classes ahead of his age. After finishing school at 14, he worked as a clerk while waiting to earn a government scholarship to study in Britain. [1][3]

In 1947, Lewis married Gladys Jacobs, who was from Grenada. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Barbara. Lewis' travels for work meant the family was often separated, but they remained united through their mutual love. [5]

## Career
Lewis attended the London School of Economics (LSE) on a government scholarship, becoming the first black student accepted there. He initially planned to study business administration and law, but excelled in economics and earned his PhD in 1940. [1][2][4]

Lewis began lecturing at LSE in 1938 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a full professor at the University of Manchester in 1948 at the young age of 33. He published extensively on industrial economics, the history of the world economy, and most notably, development economics. [1][2][5]

In 1954, Lewis published his seminal work "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour", which laid the foundations for the field of development economics. This work was key to his Nobel Prize nomination 25 years later. [4]

Beyond academia, Lewis served as an economic advisor to several governments, including Ghana and the Caribbean Development Bank, which he helped establish and led from 1970-1973. [1][3][4]

## Achievements
In 1979, Lewis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, along with Theodore Schultz, for their pioneering research into economic development, particularly the problems of developing countries. [1][3][5]

Lewis was knighted in 1963 for his contributions to economics. The Sir Arthur Lewis Community College in St. Lucia, the Arthur Lewis Building at the University of Manchester, and the Arthur Lewis Auditorium at Princeton University were all named in his honor. [1][3][4]
