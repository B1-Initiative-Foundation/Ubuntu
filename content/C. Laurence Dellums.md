Cottrell Laurence Dellums was born on January 3, 1900, in Corsicana, Texas[1]. He moved to Oakland, California, at the age of 23 to escape racial segregation and pursue a law degree, but instead began work as a Pullman porter due to limited job opportunities for African Americans at the time[2]. Dellums rose to the position of International President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and was also a member of the Fair Employment Practices Commission[2]. He was instrumental in getting FDR to open wartime industries to Blacks[2]. Dellums was a civil rights activist and labor leader who fought for fair treatment and civil rights for African Americans[2]. He was also the uncle of U.S. Representative and Oakland mayor Ron Dellums[2]. There is a building named for him near the African American Museum and Library at Oakland, and a statue of him stands at the Jack London Square Amtrak station[2].
