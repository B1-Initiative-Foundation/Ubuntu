Henry Ossian Flipper was the first African American graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1877.[1][2][3] He served as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, but his military career was cut short when he was accused of embezzlement and conduct unbecoming an officer in 1881.[2] Flipper maintained his innocence throughout his life and continued to work as a surveyor, translator, and mining engineer after his dismissal from the Army.[2][3] In 1999, President Bill Clinton issued a posthumous pardon to Flipper, acknowledging that his conviction was unjust.[3]

Henry Ossian Flipper was the first African American graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Despite facing significant racial prejudice and discrimination, he had a distinguished military career and made important contributions as an engineer, surveyor, and expert on land rights and property law.

## Personal Life
Flipper was born into slavery in 1856 in Thomasville, Georgia. After the Civil War, his parents Festus and Isabelle Flipper worked as a shoemaker and carriage trimmer, respectively, in Atlanta. Flipper attended schools operated by the American Missionary Association and later enrolled at Atlanta University. [1]

## Career
In 1873, Flipper was nominated to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point by a white Republican congressman from Georgia. He graduated in 1877, becoming the first African American to do so, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 10th U.S. Cavalry, one of the "Buffalo Soldier" regiments. [1][4]

Flipper served with distinction on the frontier, including surveying and overseeing the construction of drainage systems to address malaria outbreaks at Fort Sill. He was later court-martialed in 1881 on charges of "conduct unbecoming an officer" related to a discrepancy in commissary funds, though he was acquitted of embezzlement. Despite maintaining his innocence, he was dismissed from the Army. [1][2][3]

After leaving the military, Flipper worked as a translator, surveyor, and mining engineer, including for the U.S. Department of Justice and Mexican mining companies. He also provided intelligence on conditions in Mexico to the U.S. Senate during the Mexican Revolution. From 1921 to 1923, Flipper served as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Interior. [1][4]

## Achievements
Flipper's graduation from West Point and commission as the first African American officer in the U.S. Army was a major milestone for racial equality. He was a skilled engineer and surveyor, with his work at Fort Sill earning him recognition as a National Historic Landmark. Flipper also authored two memoirs providing rare firsthand accounts of African American life on the frontier. [1][2]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Flipper's court-martial and dismissal from the Army were controversial, with many historians believing the charges were racially motivated. In 1976, the Army's Board for Correction of Military Records overturned the "conduct unbecoming" charge, and in 1999 President Clinton issued Flipper a posthumous pardon. [2][3]
