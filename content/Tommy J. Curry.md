In 2018, Curry won an American Book Award for his book "The Man-Not: Race, Class, Genre, and the Dilemmas of Black Manhood".[1][4][5] The book is regarded as controversial for its discussion of the rape of Black males during American slavery by White men, its depiction of White feminism as the perfection of patriarchy and American imperialism, and its documentation of the rape and domestic abuse Black males suffer at the hands of Black men and women.[5] However, the book has received positive reviews in Masculinity Studies, Black Studies, and Gender Studies journals.[5]

Curry is considered the "Father of Black Male Studies" for his work in establishing this new field of study that looks at the experiences and historical development of Black men.[5] In 2018, he became the editor of the Black Male Studies book series, which is claimed to be the first of its kind.[5]

## Personal Life
Curry received his master's degree from DePaul University in 2004 and his doctorate in philosophy from Southern Illinois University in 2008.

[2]

## Career
Curry is currently a Professor of Philosophy and holds the Personal Chair of Africana Philosophy and Black Male Studies at the University of Edinburgh. [1][3] His research interests include 19th century ethnology, Critical Race Theory, and Black Male Studies. [1][3] 

He is the author of two acclaimed books: "The Man-Not: Race, Class, Genre, and the Dilemmas of Black Manhood" (2017), which won the 2018 American Book Award, and "Another White Man's Burden: Josiah Royce's Quest for a Philosophy of Racial Empire" (2018), which won the Josiah Royce Prize in American Idealist Thought. [1][2] Curry is also the editor of the first book series dedicated to the study of Black males, titled "Black Male Studies: A Series Exploring the Paradoxes of Racially Subjugated Males" on Temple University Press. [3]

## Achievements
In addition to his books, Curry's work has been recognized with several academic awards and honors. In 2017, he was awarded the Alain Locke Award by the Society of American Philosophy for his public intellectual research on the death and dying of Black males, and the rape of Black men and boys in the United States. [2] In 2018, he was named one of the Top 15 Emerging Scholars of Color in the United States. [3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
In 2017, Curry was targeted by alt-right and neo-Nazi websites for comments he had made on a 2012 podcast, comparing revolutionary violence and armed self-defense in the United States. However, according to Snopes and Curry's colleagues, his statements had been taken out of context. [2] Curry's case was part of a broader pattern of White supremacists targeting U.S. college campuses following the election of Donald Trump as president. [2]
