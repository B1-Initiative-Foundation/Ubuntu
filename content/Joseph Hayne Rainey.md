## Personal Life

Joseph Hayne Rainey was born on June 21, 1832 in Georgetown, South Carolina to Grace and Edward L. Rainey. [1][3] His father Edward was a barber who was able to purchase the freedom of himself, his wife, and their two sons in the early 1840s. [3][4] Rainey received some private schooling as a child, but like many African Americans at the time, his educational opportunities were severely limited. [3] 

In 1859, Rainey traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he met and married Susan, a free woman of color from the West Indies who was also of African-French descent. [3] The couple returned to South Carolina, where their three children - Joseph II, Herbert, and Olivia - were born. [3]

## Career

During the American Civil War, Rainey was conscripted by the Confederates to work on fortifications in Charleston, South Carolina and as a cook and laborer on blockade runner ships. [3] In 1862, Rainey and his family escaped to the British Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, where they remained until the end of the war in 1865. [3][4]

After the war, Rainey returned to South Carolina and became involved in Republican politics. He was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1868 and served briefly in the state Senate before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1870. [3][4] Rainey was the first African American to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and the second African American to serve in the U.S. Congress. [1][3]

Rainey was reelected to the House four times, serving from 1870 to 1879, the longest tenure of any African American politician during the Reconstruction era. [1][3] While in office, he dedicated himself to the passage of civil rights legislation, advocating for the interests of African Americans as well as other minority groups such as Native Americans and Chinese Americans in California. [1][3]

## Achievements

In 1874, Rainey briefly served as Speaker pro tempore of the House of Representatives, becoming the first African American to preside over the chamber. [3][4] On December 10, 2020, the House of Representatives passed H.Res.1253 to honor Rainey by naming room H-150 in the U.S. Capitol after him, commemorating the 150th anniversary of his swearing in.
