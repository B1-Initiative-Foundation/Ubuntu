Here is a concise biography of Flemmie Pansy Kittrell:

## Personal Life
Flemmie Pansy Kittrell was born on December 25, 1904 in Henderson, North Carolina to James and Alice Kittrell. She was the eighth of nine children in a sharecropping family that emphasized the importance of education. Kittrell started working as a cook and maid at age 11 to help pay for her own schooling.[1][3]

## Career
Kittrell graduated with honors from Hampton Institute in 1928 with a B.S. degree. She then went on to earn an M.S. from Cornell University in 1930 and a Ph.D. in nutrition in 1936, becoming the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in nutrition and the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. from Cornell.[1][2][3] 

Kittrell began her career as a high school teacher, but soon became the director of nutrition at Bennett College in North Carolina. She later worked as a professor of nutrition at Hampton Institute and then as the head of the home economics department at Howard University in Washington, D.C.[2][3]

## Achievements
Kittrell was a pioneering leader in the field of home economics, with a focus on the nutrition and holistic well-being of children, especially from Black and low-income families. She directed an experimental nursery school at Howard University in the 1960s that served as a model for the federal Head Start program.[3][4] 

Kittrell also traveled extensively internationally, studying and advising on children's health and nutrition in countries like India and Ghana. She advocated for home economics education as a tool for diplomacy and global peace.[5]

The American Home Economics Association created a scholarship in Kittrell's name, and Cornell University established the Turner Kittrell Medal of Honor for alumni who have made significant contributions to inclusion and equity.[2]
