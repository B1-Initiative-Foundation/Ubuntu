George Boyer Vashon was an African American scholar, poet, lawyer, and abolitionist. He was the first African American to graduate from [[Oberlin College]] in 1844, where he was the valedictorian of his class.[1][2][3] Despite being denied admission to the Pennsylvania bar twice due to his race, Vashon became the first licensed African American attorney in New York in 1848.[1][2][3] 

Vashon was active in the abolitionist movement in Pennsylvania and was a dedicated scholar and linguist who studied Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Sanskrit.[1] He taught at various institutions including [[New York Central College]], [[Avery College]], and [[Howard University]], where he became the university's first black professor in 1867.[1][3] Vashon also played a key role in establishing the Howard University Law School.[3]

In 2010, 163 years after he was first denied admission, the Pennsylvania Bar officially admitted Vashon posthumously, recognizing his many accomplishments in law, scholarship, education and justice.[1]

George Boyer Vashon was an African American scholar, poet, lawyer, and abolitionist who made significant contributions to the fight for emancipation and education of Black people in the United States.

## Personal Life
Vashon was born on July 25, 1824 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania to an abolitionist father, John Bethune Vashon, who was a well-respected leader in Pittsburgh's Black community and instrumental in establishing the first school for Black students in the city. [4] Vashon attended his father's private school until age 13, then a public school where he displayed an aptitude for languages, eventually becoming fluent in Sanskrit, Hebrew, Persian, Greek, and Latin. [4]

In 1857, Vashon married Susan Paul Smith, the granddaughter of the Rev. Thomas Paul, Sr. of Boston. The couple had seven children together. [3][4]

## Career
At age 16, Vashon enrolled at Oberlin Collegiate Institute (later Oberlin College) in Ohio, where he became the first African American to graduate in 1844, delivering the valedictory address. [3][4] He went on to earn a Master of Arts degree from Oberlin in 1849. [3]

After being denied admission to the bar in Pennsylvania due to his race, Vashon passed the bar exam in New York in 1848, becoming the first African American lawyer in the state. [2][3][4] He then spent 30 months teaching in Haiti before returning to the U.S. and practicing law in Syracuse, New York. [3]

From 1854 to 1857, Vashon was a professor of belles-lettres and mathematics at New York Central College, becoming just the third African American to hold a teaching post at a college or university. [3][5] He later served as the second Black president of Avery College in Pittsburgh from 1864 to 1867. [3]

After the Civil War, Vashon worked in the Solicitor's Office of the Freedmen's Bureau in Washington, D.C. and became the first Black professor at Howard University, where he was instrumental in establishing the law school. [3][5] He also taught at Alcorn University in Mississippi from 1874 until his death in 1878. [3]

## Achievements
Vashon was a prominent abolitionist and civil rights activist, attending national conventions and corresponding with Frederick Douglass. [3][4] He was elected as a delegate to advocate for the passage of the 15th Amendment before the 40th Congress. [2]

Vashon High School in St. Louis, Missouri is named after him and his son, John Boyer Vashon.  In 2010, 163 years after his initial application, the Pennsylvania Bar admitted Vashon posthumously. 

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Vashon faced significant racial discrimination throughout his life, being denied admission to the bar in Pennsylvania in 1847 and 1868 due to his "Negro descent."[1] Judge Thomas Mellon claimed that "social equality and connection between the races in the domestic relations can only be productive of evil" and proposed a separate territory for Black Americans. [1]

Vashon authored the epic poem "Vincent Oge" while practicing law in Syracuse, New York in the 1850s. [3]
