Oswald Garrison Villard was a prominent figure in the founding and early years of the NAACP. He used his wealth and influence to help establish the organization, providing funding, office space, and organizational leadership.[1][2][3] Villard originally supported Booker T. Washington's more moderate approach, but became convinced of the need for a more militant civil rights strategy after the Brownsville affair and Atlanta riot.[3] 

Villard served as the first chairman of the NAACP's board of directors from 1911 to 1914, before resigning due to differences with W.E.B. Du Bois.[1][2][3] However, he remained on the NAACP's board until his death in 1949.[1][3] Villard was also a founder of the American Anti-Imperialist League and used his positions at The Nation and New York Evening Post to promote liberal causes like women's suffrage and anti-imperialism.[4]
