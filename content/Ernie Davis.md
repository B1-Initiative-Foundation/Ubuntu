Ernie Davis was an American college football player who won the Heisman Trophy in 1961, becoming the first African American to receive the prestigious award. [2][3][4]

## Personal Life
Davis was born on December 14, 1939, in New Salem, Pennsylvania. His father died shortly after his birth, and he was raised by his maternal grandparents until the age of 12, when he went to live with his mother and stepfather in Elmira, New York. [2][3][4] Despite facing financial difficulties and a stuttering problem in his youth, Davis excelled in sports, particularly basketball and football, at Elmira Free Academy, earning high school All-American honors. [2][3][4]

## Career
Davis played college football for the Syracuse Orangemen from 1959 to 1961. As a sophomore in 1960, he led Syracuse to an undefeated season and a national championship, earning the nickname "The Elmira Express". [1][2][3][4] In his junior and senior seasons, Davis was named a first-team All-American and in 1961, he won the Heisman Trophy as the nation's top college football player, becoming the first African American to receive the award. [2][3][4] During his college career, Davis broke several of Syracuse's school records, including rushing yards, all-purpose yards, scoring, and touchdowns. [5]

## Achievements
Davis was selected with the first overall pick in the 1962 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins, who then traded him to the Cleveland Browns. [1][2][3][4] However, before he could play a professional game, Davis was diagnosed with leukemia in July 1962. [1][2][3][4] Despite undergoing treatment, the disease ultimately claimed his life on May 18, 1963, at the age of 23. [1][2][3][4] Davis was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1979, and the Syracuse football team later retired the number 44, which he had worn. [2][3][4]
