Sherrill D. Luke was a prominent African-American figure at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the mid-20th century. He grew up in Los Angeles and attended UCLA, where he was active in student life.

After graduating from UCLA in 1950, Luke went on to have a successful career, including working as a legislative secretary. [3] He remained involved with UCLA, and in 1985 the LuValle Commons building on campus was named after him and [[James "Jimmy" LuValle]], another pioneering African-American Bruin.

Sherrill D. Luke was a pioneering African American leader at UCLA in the 1950s.

After graduating from UCLA, Luke went on to become a judge, serving on California's Superior Court.[2] He remained actively involved with UCLA, serving as a member of the Foundation Board of Directors, as president of the Alumni Association, and as a UC Regent, where he advocated for UCLA to take an active role in creating a more tolerant society.[2]
