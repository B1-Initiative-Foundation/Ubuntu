Lillian Wald was a pioneering nurse and social reformer who founded the Henry Street Settlement in New York City in 1893 and helped establish the NAACP in 1909. [2][3] She was a fierce advocate for women's rights, women's suffrage, and equal rights for Black Americans. [2][3] Wald organized 18 district nursing service centers that treated 4,500 patients in New York by 1903.  She also campaigned against the film "Birth of a Nation" which celebrated the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacy.

Lillian Wald was a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. [1][2]

Wald was an active campaigner for civil rights and insisted that all classes at the Henry Street Settlement she founded were racially integrated. [1][2] She participated in protests against the film "Birth of a Nation", which celebrated the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacy. [1] Wald's commitment to racial equality and her involvement in founding the NAACP demonstrate her important role as a civil rights activist.
