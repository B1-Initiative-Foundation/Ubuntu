Keith Ratliff was a long-time member and leader of the [[NAACP]] in Iowa and Nebraska. [1] He was known for his vocal opposition to the NAACP's 2012 decision to support same-sex marriage, which he saw as a betrayal of the organization's religious and civil rights roots. [1] Ratliff resigned from the NAACP's national board over this issue, predicting that some local NAACP members would also leave the organization. [1] 

Despite his disagreement with the NAACP's stance on same-sex marriage, Ratliff acknowledged the important roles that gay and lesbian activists like [[Bayard Rustin]] played in the civil rights movement. [1] However, he felt that the struggles of African-Americans were distinct from those of the LGBTQ community and should not be equated. [1]

Ratliff's resignation highlighted the internal divisions within the NAACP over the organization's increasing focus on LGBTQ rights, which some traditional members saw as a departure from its core mission of racial equality. [1][2] His vocal opposition to the NAACP's marriage equality resolution demonstrated the complex and sometimes contentious relationship between the civil rights and LGBTQ rights movements.
