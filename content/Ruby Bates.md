Ruby Bates came from a poor white family in [[Huntsville]], [[Alabama]]. Her mother was a prostitute and her father was an abusive alcoholic.[1] At age 15, Bates took a job at a cotton mill in [[Huntsville]].[1] 

In 1931, Bates and [[Victoria Price]] falsely accused nine black youths, known as the [[Scottsboro Boys]], of raping them on a freight train.[2][3] Bates later recanted her story, admitting she had lied because she was "frightened by the ruling class of Scottsboro."[1][5] She went on to actively campaign for the release of the jailed black defendants.[1]

Bates faced intense scorn from the southern public after recanting her testimony. She joined the [[International Labor Defense]] and [[Communist Party]] campaigns to free the [[Scottsboro Boys]].[1][5] Bates made speeches, participated in rallies and marches, and even met with the Speaker of the House and Vice President.[1] 

In 1940, Bates moved to [[Washington]] state, where she married. She returned to [[Alabama]] in the 1960s and died in 1976 at the age of 63.[1]

Based on the search results, here is a concise answer to the question:

Ruby Bates was one of the two white women who falsely accused nine young African American men, known as the "Scottsboro Boys", of raping them on a train in Alabama in 1931[1][2][3][4]. Bates later recanted her testimony and actively campaigned for the release of the jailed black defendants[1][2][3]. 

Bates had a difficult childhood - her mother was a prostitute and her father was an abusive alcoholic[1]. As a poor millworker in Huntsville, Alabama, Bates was one of the prosecution witnesses in the initial Scottsboro trials, but she proved to be an ineffective and unreliable witness[1]. Less than nine months after the first trial, Bates wrote a letter denying that the "Negroes" had touched her, saying "i wish those Negroes are not Burnt on account of me"[1].

Bates later became a surprise witness for the defense, recanting her story of rape and stating that she and the other accuser, Victoria Price, had made the false accusation to avoid potential charges of vagrancy or violating the Mann Act[1][3][5]. Bates faced intense scorn and criticism in the South for her change in testimony[1][3]. She went on to join the International Labor Defense campaign to free the Scottsboro Boys, making speeches and meeting with political leaders[1][3]. Bates later moved to Washington state, where she married and lived until her death in 1976[3].
