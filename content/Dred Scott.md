Dred Scott was an enslaved African American man who, along with his wife Harriet, unsuccessfully sued for their freedom in the landmark Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford in 1857. The Court ruled that as a person of African descent, Scott was not a citizen and therefore could not sue in federal court. This decision helped propel the United States towards the Civil War. Though Scott did not win his freedom through the courts, he was eventually freed by private arrangement in 1857. He died of tuberculosis a year later in 1858[1][2][3].

Dred Scott was an enslaved African American man who, along with his wife Harriet, unsuccessfully sued for their freedom in the landmark Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford in 1857. [1][2][3][4]

## Personal Life
Dred Scott was born into slavery around 1799 in Virginia. [1] In 1818, he was taken by his enslaver Peter Blow and his family to Alabama.  In 1830, Dred was taken to St. Louis, Missouri, where Peter Blow died.  Dred was subsequently bought by army surgeon Dr. John Emerson, who later took Dred to the free state of Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory, where slavery was prohibited. [3] While in Wisconsin, Dred met and married Harriet Robinson, another enslaved person owned by Emerson. [3]

## Career
Dred Scott did not have a formal career, as he was an enslaved person for most of his life. However, he is known for his legal battle for freedom, which eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. [1][2][3][4]

## Achievements
Dred Scott's most significant achievement was his legal challenge to slavery, which became one of the most infamous Supreme Court decisions in U.S. history. [1][2][3][4] Though he ultimately lost his case, it helped to further inflame tensions between the North and South, and was a significant precursor to the American Civil War. [2][4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
The Dred Scott decision was widely condemned as a grave injustice, as it ruled that African Americans could never be citizens of the United States and that the federal government had no power to prohibit slavery in its territories. [2][4] The decision was later nullified by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments following the Civil War. [2]
