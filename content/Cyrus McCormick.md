Cyrus McCormick was an American inventor who revolutionized farming with his invention of the mechanical reaper.[1][2][3] Born in [[Walnut Grove]], [[Virginia]], McCormick grew up on a farm and was inspired by his father's attempts to create an effective reaping machine.[1][4] After several years of experimentation, McCormick patented his reaper design in 1834 and began manufacturing and selling the machines.[1][2] 

McCormick's reaper was a major breakthrough, as it could harvest wheat much more efficiently than manual labor.[1][2][3] He overcame strong resistance to new technology and developed innovative marketing strategies, such as offering money-back guarantees, to make his reaper a commercial success.[1] By 1850, McCormick's reapers were outselling all competitors, and he became known as the "father of the mechanical reaper."[4][5]

McCormick's invention had a profound impact on agriculture, enabling farmers to dramatically increase their productivity and output.[1][2] This in turn helped to end hunger around the world and fueled the industrial revolution by freeing up labor for other industries.[1] McCormick's company later merged with other farm equipment manufacturers to form the International Harvester Company, which became a major force in the industry.[4]

Cyrus McCormick was the inventor and entrepreneur who made the mechanical reaper a commercial success. The key points are:

- Cyrus McCormick was born in Virginia in 1809 and derived his interest in invention from his father, Robert McCormick, who had worked for many years to try to perfect a mechanical reaper without success. [2][3]

- In 1831, Cyrus McCormick succeeded where his father had failed, producing a model reaper with all the essential components of later commercial machines. He patented his invention in 1834. [2][3]

- McCormick started manufacturing the reaper on the family estate in 1837 and began licensing its manufacture in other parts of the country in 1843. In 1874, he set up a factory in Chicago, which became one of the greatest industrial establishments in the United States. [2][3][4]

- McCormick was an astute businessman who increased sales through door-to-door canvassing and written guarantees for his ready-to-assemble machinery. He amassed a large fortune and invested widely in railroad and mining enterprises. [3][4]

- While McCormick was not the sole inventor of the reaper, he was the entrepreneur who successfully commercialized and marketed the technology, making it a widespread success that transformed agriculture. [4]

In summary, Cyrus McCormick was the key figure who took the reaper from invention to commercial success through his business acumen and marketing efforts, even though the underlying technology built on the work of others. [4]
