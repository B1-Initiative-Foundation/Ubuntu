Here is a concise biography of Gerardus Mercator:

## Personal Life
Gerardus Mercator was born on March 5, 1512 in Rupelmonde, Flanders (now Belgium) to Hubert Cremer and Emerentiana. [1][2] He studied humanities and philosophy at the University of Louvain, where he received a master's degree in 1532. [1][2] Mercator was an introspective and energetic individual who had deep interests in mathematics, astronomy, cosmography, and theology. 

## Career
After graduating, Mercator became a skilled engraver, calligrapher, and scientific instrument maker. He and his colleagues made Louvain a center for the construction of maps, globes, and astronomical instruments. In 1544, Mercator was accused of heresy due to his suspected tolerance for Lutheranism and spent seven months in prison, before being freed with the help of the University of Louvain.  In 1552, he moved to Duisburg, Germany, where he opened a workshop and taught mathematics at a university preparatory school. 

In 1564, Mercator was appointed court cosmographer to Duke Wilhelm of Cleve. In 1569, he perfected the map projection that bears his name, which allowed mariners to steer a course over long distances by plotting straight lines without continually adjusting compass readings. 

## Achievements
Mercator's most significant contribution was the development of the Mercator projection, which greatly enlarged areas distant from the equator and allowed for accurate navigation. He also made important contributions as a cartographer, geographer, and publisher of atlases and globes. 

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
There is no evidence that Mercator had any racist, homophobic, or antisemitic views, or any connections to hate groups.  He did face accusations of heresy due to his suspected tolerance for Lutheranism, but was ultimately freed from prison with the help of the University of Louvain. 

## Bibliography
Mercator did not author any books, but he published numerous atlases, maps, and globes over the course of his career.
