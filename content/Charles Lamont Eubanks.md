In 1941, Charles Lamont Eubanks, a 17-year-old honor student who had graduated from [[Central High School]] in [[Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], applied for admission to the [[University of Kentucky]]'s College of Engineering.[1][2] However, his application was denied because he was African American and the Kentucky Day Law did not permit African Americans and whites to attend the same schools.[1] 

The NAACP took on Eubanks' case, which is considered a landmark in the struggle for equal rights in higher education.[1] Eubanks' counsel, [[Charles H. Houston]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]], objected to the two-year engineering program established at the segregated [[Kentucky State College]] (now [[Kentucky State University]]) for African American students seeking an engineering degree.[1] An amended complaint was filed with the Federal District Court in [[Lexington]], [[Kentucky]] with a request for $5,000 in damages.[1] However, the case was eventually dismissed in 1945 after Eubanks signed an affidavit asking that the case not be continued.[1] Despite the disappointing outcome, the Charles Eubanks v University of Kentucky case is still regarded as a significant event in the fight for desegregation in higher education.[1][4]

Charles Lamont Eubanks was a 17-year-old African American student from Louisville, Kentucky who in 1941 became the plaintiff in the first Kentucky case the NAACP brought against a university to challenge racial segregation in higher education.[1]

## Personal Life
Eubanks was an honor student who had graduated from Central High School in Louisville.[1] He applied for admission to the University of Kentucky (UK) College of Engineering, but his application was denied because he was African American and the Kentucky Day Law did not permit African Americans and whites to attend the same schools.[1]

## Career
Eubanks volunteered to be the subject in an attempt to integrate the University of Kentucky.[1] His counsel, Charles H. Houston and Thurgood Marshall, filed an amended complaint with the Federal District Court in Lexington, Kentucky, requesting $5,000 in damages.[1] However, as the case dragged on, Eubanks suffered from depression, was criticized for creating tension between Kentucky African Americans and whites, was rejected when he tried to enlist in the Army, and was even divorced by his wife.[1]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
While the Eubanks case was pending, the Kentucky Board of Education voted to establish a two-year engineering course at the historically Black Kentucky State College (now Kentucky State University) for African American students seeking an engineering degree.[1] Eubanks' counsel objected to this "makeshift" program, but Eubanks eventually signed an affidavit asking that the case not be continued, and the case was dismissed in 1945.[1] Thurgood Marshall was disappointed at the outcome of the case, and Charles W. Anderson blamed Kentucky State College President Atwood for weakening the case.[1]
