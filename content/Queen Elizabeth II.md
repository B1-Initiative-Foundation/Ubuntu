## Personal Life
Elizabeth was born in 1926 as the elder daughter of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI) and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. As a child, she was not expected to become queen, but her uncle's abdication in 1936 made her father the king and Elizabeth the heir presumptive. [2] During World War II, Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret spent much of their time away from London to avoid the Blitz. In 1947, Elizabeth married her distant cousin, Philip Mountbatten, with whom she had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. [1][2]
