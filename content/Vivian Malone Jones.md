## Personal Life
Vivian Malone was born on July 15, 1942 in Monroe County, Alabama. Her parents both worked at Brookley Air Force Base - her father in maintenance and her mother as a domestic servant. Her parents emphasized the importance of education and ensured that all of their eight children attended college. Vivian attended Central High School in Mobile, where she was a member of the National Honor Society. [3][4]

After high school, Vivian attended Alabama A&M University, a historically Black college, and received a bachelor's degree in business education in 1962. She then applied to transfer to the University of Alabama to pursue a degree in accounting, a field not offered at Alabama A&M at the time. [3][4]

In 1963, Vivian Malone and James Hood were chosen to be the first two Black students to desegregate the University of Alabama. On June 11, 1963, they arrived on campus accompanied by federal marshals, despite Alabama Governor George Wallace physically blocking their entry. After President Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard, Malone and Hood were able to complete their registration. [1][2][3][4]

Malone went on to graduate in 1965 with a bachelor's degree in business management, becoming the university's first Black graduate. [1][2][3][4] After graduation, she joined the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice as a research analyst. She later earned a master's degree in public administration from George Washington University. [3][4]

Malone went on to hold several prominent roles, including Executive Director of the Voter Education Project, Director of Civil Rights and Urban Affairs at the EPA, and Director of Environmental Justice at the EPA, a position she held until her retirement in 1996. [1][3][4]
