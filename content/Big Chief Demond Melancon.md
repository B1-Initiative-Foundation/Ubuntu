## Personal Life
Demond Melancon was born and raised in the New Orleans Lower Ninth Ward. When he was 14 years old, he had the opportunity to learn from influential elder Big Chiefs who taught him how to sew and bead intricate suits, as well as the history and traditions of the Black Masking Culture of New Orleans.  He was initially mentored by a prolific elder named Big Chief Ferdinand Bigard, and later studied under Nathanial Williams in connection with a 1993 Louisiana Folklife Apprenticeship Grant. 

## Career
Melancon joined the Seminole Hunters and masked as a Spy Boy for over 15 years under Big Chief Keitoe Jones. In 2012, the elders of the Black Masking community declared that Melancon would be known as Big Chief Demond Melancon of the Young Seminole Hunters, his own tribe based in the Lower Ninth Ward. 

Melancon's suits are sculptural forms, based on the size of his body and composed of intricate, hand-sewn beadwork revealing a collective visual narrative.  In 2017, Melancon pioneered a contemporary art practice using the same beading techniques he has been refining over the past 30 years in the Black Masking Culture. 

## Achievements
Melancon's work has been included in exhibitions at prestigious institutions such as the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Art in Brooklyn, the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, the Haus der Welt der Kulturen in Berlin, and the Arthur Roger Gallery in New Orleans. His work is also included in the collections of the International African American Museum, Toledo Museum of Art, Birmingham Museum of Art, LSU Museum of Art, and the Boston Art Club.
