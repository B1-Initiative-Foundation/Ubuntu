Roy Wright was one of the nine African American teenagers, known as the Scottsboro Boys, who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a freight train in 1931 in Alabama. [1][2][3][4]

At the initial trial, the 13-year-old Roy Wright testified that he had seen some of the other defendants rape the two women, but later claimed this testimony was coerced. His own trial ended in a hung jury, with 11 jurors seeking a death sentence and one voting for life imprisonment. [2] 

Roy Wright spent the next six years in jail before being released in 1937. [2] After his release, he joined the vaudeville circuit with some of the other Scottsboro Boys. [2] 

In 1939, Roy Wright wrote about his experiences, saying "I am trying all that in my power to be brave but you understand a person can be brave for a certain length of time."[2] 

In 1959, after returning home from a tour at sea, Roy Wright killed his wife in a fit of jealous rage and then committed suicide. [3][5]

Here is a concise and accurate response to the question about Leroy R. "Roy" Wright, one of the Scottsboro Boys:

Roy Wright was the youngest of the Scottsboro Boys, being only 12 or 13 years old when he was arrested in 1931.[1][2] Wright was from Chattanooga, Tennessee and was on his first trip away from home when he was arrested along with the other defendants.[1][2] 

At the initial trial, Wright testified that he had seen some of the other defendants rape the two white women, but later claimed this testimony was coerced after he was threatened and beaten by authorities.[1][2] Wright's own trial ended in a hung jury, with 11 jurors seeking a death sentence and 1 voting for life imprisonment.[2] 

Wright spent the next six years in jail, often in solitary confinement, and complained about the poor treatment he received from prison officials.[1][2] In 1937, Wright was released along with three other defendants and joined the vaudeville circuit.[1] After his release, Wright served in the army, got married, and took a job with the merchant marine.[2] 

Tragically, in 1959 Wright shot and killed his wife after becoming convinced she had been unfaithful, and then killed himself.[2] The Scottsboro case had a profound impact on Wright's life, with the trauma and injustice he experienced contributing to his later struggles and tragic end.[1][2]
