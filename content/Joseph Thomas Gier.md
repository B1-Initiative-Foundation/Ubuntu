Joseph Thomas Gier was the first Black tenured professor at the University of California.[1][2] He was raised in [[Oakland]], [[California]] by a single mother who worked as a domestic servant.[1] Despite the odds, Gier came to [[Berkeley]] in 1930, became the president of his fraternity, and was one of the first Black students to earn a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 1933.[1] 

Gier went on to become a world authority in his field, co-inventing and patenting several instruments used to measure thermal and luminous radiation.[1][2] He was an early proponent of solar energy as a renewable resource.[1] Gier was promoted to Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering with tenure at [[Berkeley]] in 1952, and was later promoted to Full Professor in 1958.[2] 

In 1958, Gier transferred to [[UCLA]] at the invitation of the dean, as his research interests had shifted more towards solar energy, which was not as well-supported in the Electrical Engineering department at [[Berkeley]].[2] Tragically, Gier passed away in 1961 at the age of 50, at the height of his career.[2]

Gier was known for his patience, kindness, and compassion, and was a role model to many students and colleagues.[2] His legacy lives on through the Morrin-Gier-Martinelli Heat Transfer Memorial Laboratory at [[UCLA]], which continues his work in heat transfer and energy applications.[2] Gier's pioneering achievements as a Black scientist and educator paved the way for many who followed him.
