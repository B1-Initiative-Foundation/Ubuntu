In 1981, Diana married Charles, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent to the British throne.[1][3] Together they had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.[1][3] However, the marriage was troubled, and the couple formally separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.[1]

Diana was widely admired for her charity work and compassion, earning her the nickname "the People's Princess".[1][3] She was awarded the Order of the Garter, the Order of the British Empire, and the French Legion of Honour for her humanitarian efforts.[1] After her divorce, Diana continued her charitable work and became an outspoken advocate for banning landmines.[1][3]
