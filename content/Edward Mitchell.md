Edward Mitchell was the first student of African descent to graduate from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1828, making him the first Black alumnus of an Ivy League institution.[1][2][3] Born in [[Saint-Pierre]], [[Martinique]], Mitchell had been a sailor and porter before coming to [[Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]] to pursue his education.[1][2] 

Initially, the [[Dartmouth College]] Board of Trustees denied Mitchell's application due to concerns about offending the student body, but a student-led protest led the trustees to reverse their decision and admit him.[1][3] During his time at Dartmouth, Mitchell was "very highly respected by the government [i.e., the faculty] and the students."[1] After graduating, Mitchell was ordained as a Baptist minister and moved to [[Georgeville]], [[Quebec]], where he led a Baptist congregation until his death in 1872.[1][2]

Here is a concise biography of Edward Mitchell, the first Black graduate of Dartmouth College:

## Personal Life
Edward Mitchell was born in 1792 in Saint-Pierre, Martinique, a French slave colony. He was the son of a free "mul√¢tresse" (mixed-race woman) named Olive and an unnamed Frenchman.[1][3] In 1810, at age 18, Mitchell left Martinique and traveled to Portland, Maine, where he lived with the family of Captain William Prentiss.[3] Mitchell later moved to Philadelphia, where he became involved with the city's African American religious and civic leaders.[3]

## Career
In 1824, Mitchell applied to Dartmouth College but was initially denied admission by the Board of Trustees due to concerns about his race.[1][2] However, Dartmouth students protested the decision, and Mitchell was eventually admitted.[1][2] He graduated from Dartmouth in 1828, becoming the first person of African descent to graduate from the Ivy League.[1][2] After graduation, Mitchell was ordained as a Baptist minister and traveled through New Hampshire, Vermont, and Lower Canada on evangelical missions, eventually settling in Georgeville, Canada in 1837.[1][3]

## Achievements
Mitchell was the first person of African descent to graduate from Dartmouth College and the third self-identified man of African ancestry to graduate from any American college.[1][2] He is considered a trailblazer and inspiration for Dartmouth's legacy in educating students of African descent.[5]
