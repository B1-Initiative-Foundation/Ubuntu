Julian Herman Lewis was an American pathologist who became the first African-American associate professor at the University of Chicago in 1922. [1][2] His research interests included racial differences in relation to medicine and immunology, and he earned a Guggenheim Fellowship for research in immunology in 1926. [1] Lewis's most well-known work was his 1942 publication "The Biology of the Negro", which presented extensive evidence debunking racist notions that linked supposed black inferiority to biology. [1][2] Though the book received mostly positive reviews, it sold poorly and Lewis published no further works after 1943. [1] Lewis was a mentor to many prominent African Americans at the University of Chicago, including dancer Katherine Dunham. [3] He is considered a pioneer in the field of "anthropathology", the study of racial differences in the expression of disease. [2][3]

Julian Herman Lewis was an accomplished African American pathologist, educator, and author who challenged racism in the medical and scientific communities in the early 20th century. Here is a summary of his life and work:

## Personal Life
Julian Herman Lewis was born on May 26, 1891 in Shawneetown, Illinois to John Calhoun Lewis and Cordelia O. Scott Lewis, both of whom were former slaves who became educators. Lewis attended the University of Illinois, graduating in 1911 with a bachelor's degree and earning a master's degree the following year. He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he completed his PhD in physiology and pathology in 1915, graduating magna cum laude. Lewis later earned his medical degree from Rush Medical College in 1917, becoming one of the first African Americans to hold both an MD and a PhD. In 1918, he married Eva Overton, whose father Anthony Overton was the first African American to own a major business conglomerate. Together, Julian and Eva had three children - Gloria, Julian, and John.

## Career
After earning his medical degree, Lewis joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1917, becoming the first African American faculty member hired by the university. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1923 and served on the faculty for over 25 years, conducting research on topics such as racial differences in blood types and the prevalence of diseases in the African American community[3][4]. 

Lewis's most well-known work was his 1942 book "The Biology of the Negro", which presented extensive evidence debunking racist notions of black biological inferiority[1][5]. He is considered the "Father of Anthropathology" for his pioneering research in this area. However, his focus on the biological aspects of race was controversial, and he faced challenges in the academic community[3].

## Achievements
Lewis received numerous honors and awards throughout his career, including being inducted into Sigma Xi, Phi Beta Kappa, and Alpha Omega Alpha as a student[5]. In 1926, he was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship to conduct research in Switzerland[4]. He was also featured in prominent publications like Life and Time magazines for his work[5].

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
While Lewis's research aimed to challenge racist ideologies, some criticized his focus on the biological aspects of race as being regressive[3]. There are also indications that he may have faced discrimination and was forced to leave the University of Chicago in 1943, despite his accomplishments[5].
