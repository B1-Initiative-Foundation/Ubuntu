Shauna D. Jackson made history in 1990 as the first black woman to be elected president of the prestigious Stanford Law Review.[1] At the time, she was a second-year law student at Stanford University.[1] Jackson's election was an unprecedented milestone for the 42-year-old legal journal, which had never before been led by a woman of color.[1] 

In her new role, Jackson oversaw the management, finances, editing, and direction of the influential Stanford Law Review.[1] She emphasized the importance of having diverse perspectives represented, stating that her shared leadership with her black vice president, Kevin V. Haynes, would help dispel the notion of a "monolithic 'minority point of view.'"[1] 

Jackson viewed her election as a testament to her individual accomplishments, rather than a symbolic victory.[1] She commended Stanford Law Review's membership system, which allowed students to join as associate members before submitting articles, unlike some other law reviews.[1] For her tenure, Jackson aimed to make the journal even more "competitive and prestigious, but inclusive at the same time," reaching out to underrepresented groups like women and students of color.[1]

Shauna D. Jackson made history in 1990 as the first black woman to be elected president of the prestigious Stanford Law Review.[1] At the time, the Law Review was considered one of the most influential legal publications in the nation. 

Jackson, a second-year law student from Olathe, Kansas, secured the majority of votes from the journal's 70-member staff to become its president. This was an unprecedented milestone for the 42-year-old publication. 

Gilda R. Williams, chairwoman of the National Black Law Students Association, expressed admiration for Jackson's achievement, stating that she was the first black woman she had heard of to lead a law review at a non-predominantly black institution.[1] Historically, law reviews have been crucial stepping stones for prestigious clerkships and lucrative jobs after law school.

In her new role, Jackson aimed to make the Stanford Law Review "even more competitive and prestigious, but inclusive at the same time."[1] She emphasized the importance of having women and students of color involved in the decision-making process of such an influential legal publication.
