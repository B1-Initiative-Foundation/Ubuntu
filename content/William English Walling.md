## Personal Life
William English Walling was born in 1877 into a wealthy family in Louisville, Kentucky. His father, Willoughby Walling, was a physician who had inherited real estate, and his maternal grandfather was William Hayden English, a successful businessman and the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1880.[1] Walling attended private school and later graduated from the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School.[1] After inheriting a private income, he became involved in labor and political movements, first working at Hull House in Chicago.[1][2]

## Career
In 1900, Walling moved to New York City and worked as a factory inspector.[1] In 1903, he founded the National Women's Trade Union League.[1] After investigating the 1908 Springfield Race Riot, Walling was among the co-founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.[1][4] He wrote three books on socialism in the early 20th century.[1] Walling left the Socialist Party due to its anti-war policy, as he believed U.S. participation in World War I was needed to defeat the Central Powers.[1]

## Achievements

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Walling's relationship with his wife, Anna Strunsky, became very difficult due to their political differences.
