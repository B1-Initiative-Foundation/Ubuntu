In a remarkable turn of events while filming The Saint of Fort Washington in 1993, Rhames was introduced to a homeless man who turned out to be his long-lost older brother, Junior, who had lost contact with the family after serving in Vietnam.

His big break came in 1994 when Quentin Tarantino cast him as the merciless drug dealer Marsellus Wallace in the hit film Pulp Fiction.[1][2][3] Shortly after, director Brian De Palma cast him as the ace computer hacker Luther Stickell opposite Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible.[1][2][3] 

Rhames went on to reprise the role of Luther Stickell in several Mission: Impossible sequels, making him the only actor besides Tom Cruise to appear in all seven films in the franchise.[3] His performance as boxing promoter Don King in the HBO film Don King: Only in America in 1997 earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film.[1][2][3]
