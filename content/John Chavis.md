John Chavis was the first African American known to receive a college education in the United States. He was born free in 1763 in [[Mecklenburg County]], [[Virginia]] and served as a soldier in the Revolutionary War. In 1792, he began studying for the ministry at the [[College of New Jersey]] (now [[Princeton University]]) under the tutelage of [[John Witherspoon]]. After Witherspoon's death in 1794, Chavis transferred to [[Liberty Hall Academy]] in [[Lexington]], [[Virginia]] (later renamed [[Washington Academy]] and then [[Washington and Lee University]]), where he graduated with honors in 1799. Chavis became the first African American to be licensed to preach by the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1800. He went on to open a school in [[Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]] where he taught both Black and white students, including the children of prominent North Carolinians. Chavis was a vocal advocate for the education of African Americans and the gradual emancipation of slaves, but was forced to stop teaching after North Carolina passed laws restricting the rights of free Black people following the [[Nat Turner's Rebellion]] in 1831. Chavis died under mysterious circumstances in 1838. He is considered one of the most remarkable African Americans of the antebellum South.

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
After the Nat Turner rebellion in 1831, laws were passed in Virginia and North Carolina restricting the freedom of movement and education of free African Americans. As a result, Chavis could no longer practice his professions in North Carolina. [1] The circumstances around his death in 1838 are also considered mysterious. [1]
