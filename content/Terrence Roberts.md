Terrence Roberts was one of the nine African-American students who volunteered to desegregate [[Little Rock Central High School]] in 1957, despite facing constant intimidation and threats from those who opposed integration[1][3]. After completing his junior year at Central High, the city's high schools were closed to prevent further desegregation, so Roberts moved to [[Los Angeles]] and graduated from [[Los Angeles High School]] in 1959[1][3].

Roberts went on to earn a B.A. in sociology from [[California State University, Los Angeles]] in 1967, an M.S. in social welfare from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1970, and a Ph.D. in psychology from [[Southern Illinois University]] in 1976[1][3][4]. He served as a co-chair of the department of Master of Arts in Psychology Program at [[Antioch College]] in Los Angeles and maintained a private psychology practice[1][4].

In 1999, President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Roberts and the other members of the Little Rock Nine the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian award, in recognition of their role as "civil rights pioneers"[1][3][4]. Roberts has also published two memoirs, "Lessons from Little Rock" in 2009 and "Simple Not Easy: Reflections on Community Social Responsibility and Tolerance" in 2010[1].
