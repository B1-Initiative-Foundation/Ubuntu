## Personal Life
Lee was born on July 28, 1934 and grew up on a sharecropper's farm in Lithonia, Georgia. [2] He graduated from Bruce High School in 1953 and went on to attend Fort Valley State College in Georgia, where he received a BA degree in Sociology in 1959. [2] After serving two years in the U.S. Army, Lee worked as a juvenile probation officer in Savannah, Georgia before moving to Chapel Hill in 1964 to pursue a master's degree in social work at the University of North Carolina. [2][5]

## Career
In 1969, Lee was elected mayor of Chapel Hill, becoming the first African American to hold that position in a predominantly white southern town since Reconstruction.

[4] 

After his time as mayor, Lee served in several other prominent roles, including Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, member of the North Carolina Senate for 13 years, Chairman of the North Carolina State Board of Education, and member of the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
