Henry Louis Gates Jr. is an American literary critic, professor, historian, and filmmaker who serves as the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and the director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University.[1][2]

## Personal Life
Gates was born on September 16, 1950, in Keyser, West Virginia, to Pauline Augusta (Coleman) Gates (1916–1987) and Henry Louis Gates Sr. (c. 1913–2010).[3] He grew up in neighboring Piedmont. His father worked in a paper mill and moonlighted as a janitor, while his mother cleaned houses.[3] Later in life, Gates learned through DNA analysis that his family is descended in part from the Yoruba people of West Africa, and that he has 50% European ancestry, including Irish forebears.[3] He has also learned that he is connected to the multiracial West Virginia community of Chestnut Ridge people.[3] Gates was married to Sharon Lynn Adams from 1979 to 1999, and married Marial Iglesias Utset in 2021.[3]

## Career
Gates is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker, literary scholar, journalist, cultural critic, and institution builder.[1][2] He has published numerous books and produced and hosted an array of documentary films, including "The Black Church" (PBS), "Frederick Douglass: In Five Speeches" (HBO), and his groundbreaking genealogy and genetics series "Finding Your Roots", which has completed its ninth season on PBS and will return for a tenth season in 2024.[1][2] His most recent history series for PBS is "Making Black America: Through the Grapevine".[2]

## Achievements
Gates has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including a MacArthur "genius grant" in 1981 and the National Humanities Medal in 1998.[3] He has served on the Pulitzer Prize board and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[3][4] In 2011, his portrait was hung in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[5]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
In 2009, Gates was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after a confrontation with police at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The event led to public criticism of the Cambridge police department by then-U.S. President Barack Obama.[4]
