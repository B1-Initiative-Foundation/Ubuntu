Andy Wright was 19 years old at the time of the Scottsboro incident. He was arrested along with his younger brother Roy and several other young African American men after they were pulled off a train in Paint Rock, Alabama on March 25, 1931. [1][2][3] 

Despite a lack of evidence, Wright was convicted of rape and sentenced to 99 years in prison. He endured severe abuse and mistreatment from both prison guards and other inmates during his years of incarceration. [1][2] Wright was the last of the Scottsboro Boys to be released from prison in 1950. [1]

After his release, Wright struggled to adjust to life outside of prison. He was accused of rape again in 1951 but was acquitted. Wright later killed his wife and then himself in 1959, unable to escape the stigma of the Scottsboro case. [1][2]

Here is a concise biography of Andrew "Andy" Wright, one of the Scottsboro Boys:

## Personal Life
Andrew "Andy" Wright was born in 1912 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was the older brother of Scottsboro Boy Roy Wright. Andy attended school in Chattanooga and worked in a grocery store prior to his arrest. [2][4]

## Career
Wright was 19 years old at the time of his arrest as one of the Scottsboro Boys in 1931. He was arrested along with the other defendants upon disembarking a freight train in Alabama. [2][4] 

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Wright initially testified that he saw the other Scottsboro defendants rape the white women, but later said he had been threatened and beaten by authorities to make that statement. [2] Wright was beaten by both prison guards and other inmates during his time in jail, sometimes severely enough to require hospitalization. [2] He expressed deep depression and hopelessness about his situation, writing "It seems as though I've been in here for century an century."[2]

## Achievements
Wright was paroled in 1944 after spending over 6 years in jail without a retrial. After his release, he served in the army, got married, and took a job with the merchant marine. [2][4] However, his involvement with the Scottsboro case continued to haunt him, as he was later accused of raping a 13-year-old girl, though he was acquitted by an all-white jury. [2]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
In 1959, after returning from an extended stay at sea, Wright became convinced that his wife had been unfaithful. In a fit of jealous rage, he shot and killed his wife, then killed himself. [2]
