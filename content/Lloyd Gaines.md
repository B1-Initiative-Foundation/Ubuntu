Lloyd Lionel Gaines was the plaintiff in the landmark civil rights case Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, which resulted in a Supreme Court decision in 1938 that ruled segregation in public higher education was unconstitutional. Gaines was born in [[Water Valley]], [[Mississippi]] in 1912 and later moved to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] with his family. He excelled academically, graduating first in his class from [[Vashon High School]] in 1931. Gaines then attended [[Lincoln University]] in [[Jefferson City]], [[Missouri]], graduating with a BA in History in 1935. He applied to the [[University of Missouri]] law school in 1935 but was denied admission due to his race. Gaines and the NAACP sued the university, leading to the Supreme Court's historic decision in his favor in 1938. However, Gaines mysteriously disappeared in 1939 before he could enroll at the University of Missouri. His whereabouts remain unknown to this day. [1][2][3][4][5]

Lloyd Lionel Gaines was a pioneering civil rights figure in the 20th century United States. Here is a summary of his life and legacy:

##Personal Life
Gaines was born in 1911 in Water Valley, Mississippi to sharecropper parents Henry Richard Gaines and Callie Gaines. After his father's death, Gaines and his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1926 when he was 14 years old. [3] Gaines excelled academically, graduating first in his class from the all-black Vashon High School in 1931. [3][4]

##Career
After high school, Gaines attended Stowe Teachers College for a year on a scholarship, before transferring to Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he graduated in 1935 with a degree in history. [4] Gaines then applied to the University of Missouri School of Law in 1935, but was denied admission due to his race. [1][4] This led Gaines to file a lawsuit, Gaines v. Canada, against the university, which eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1938, the Supreme Court ruled in Gaines' favor, holding that Missouri's segregated higher education system violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. [2][3][4]

## Achievements
Gaines' victory in Gaines v. Canada was a landmark civil rights case that paved the way for the Brown v. Board of Education decision 15 years later. [1] It was a major step forward in the fight to desegregate higher education in the United States. [1][2][4] Gaines was posthumously awarded an honorary law degree from the University of Missouri in 2006, and the state bar awarded him a law license that same year. [3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Tragically, Gaines disappeared in 1939, just three months after his Supreme Court victory, and his fate remains unknown. [1][2][3] Some speculate that he was killed in retaliation for his legal triumph, while others believe he may have fled to Mexico to start a new life. [2] Gaines' family never filed a missing persons report, believing he would return when he was ready. [3] Despite the mystery surrounding his disappearance, Gaines is revered as a civil rights pioneer whose legacy continues to impact higher education in the United States. [1][2][3][4]

## Bibliography
Gaines did not author any books, as his life was cut short at the age of 28.
