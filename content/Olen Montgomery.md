Olen Montgomery was one of the nine young African American men known as the "Scottsboro Boys" who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in Alabama in 1931.[1][2][3] Despite being blind in one eye, walking with a limp, and spending most of the train trip laying on the floor of the freight car, Montgomery was arrested and charged along with the other Scottsboro Boys.[3] His conviction, like those of the other defendants, was eventually overturned, but the experience left him emotionally scarred and he battled alcoholism.[3] The details of his later life and death date are unknown.[3]

Olen Montgomery was one of the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine young African American men who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in Alabama in 1931. Here are the key details about Olen Montgomery:

## Personal Life
Olen Montgomery was born in 1913 in Monroe, Georgia. After his parents divorced, he was raised by his mother Viola, who supported the family on only $1.50 per week. Olen dropped out of school in the fifth grade to help his mother work. He was very nearsighted and blind in one eye due to a cataract[3].

## The Scottsboro Case
On March 25, 1931, Olen Montgomery, who was 17 years old at the time, was one of the nine young black men pulled off a train and falsely accused of raping two white women, Victoria Price and Ruby Bates[3][4]. Despite a lack of evidence, Olen was convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death along with several of the other Scottsboro Boys[5]. 

## Aftermath
Olen's conviction was eventually overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that the defendants had been deprived of a fair trial[5]. In July 1937, the charges against Olen and several other Scottsboro Boys were finally dismissed, and they were released from prison[5]. However, Olen and the others never received any compensation for their wrongful convictions and incarcerations[5].
