James Webster Smith was an American professor and the first black person appointed to a cadetship at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Born into slavery in 1850 in South Carolina, Smith excelled academically and was recommended for West Point by Representative Solomon L. Hoge. [4][5]

Smith faced intense racial prejudice and harassment during his time at West Point from 1870 to 1874, including hazing and physical abuse from his fellow cadets. He was subjected to multiple courts-martial and ultimately dismissed a year before completing his studies, despite appeals to the Secretary of War. [4][5]

After leaving West Point, Smith found success as a professor at the South Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical Institute. He later served as the Commander of Cadets at South Carolina State. Smith died of tuberculosis in 1876 at the age of 26. [4]

In 1996, at the request of Congressman John Spratt, President Bill Clinton approved the posthumous commission of James Webster Smith to the rank of 2nd lieutenant of the U.S. Army, stating it was "an atonement, long overdue, for what James Webster Smith had to suffer at West Point."
