Lutie Lytle was the daughter of former slaves and grew up in Topeka, Kansas. She had a deep love for the law and believed it was the "anchor of her race" and the "certificate of their liberty and equality."[2] In 1897, Lytle graduated at the top of her class from Central Tennessee Law School, which was one of the first law schools to admit women and African Americans.[1][3] This achievement received international attention, with news outlets as far as London reporting on her graduation and admission to practice law.[3] 

After graduating, Lytle briefly practiced law on her own before joining the faculty of Central Tennessee College in 1898 as a professor and law librarian, becoming one of the first female law instructors in the world.[1][3] She spent only one year teaching before returning to Topeka, where she later established a law practice with her husband in New York City.[3] Despite the limited opportunities for women as law professors at the time, Lutie Lytle's pioneering achievements as an African American woman in the legal field paved the way for future generations.[1][2][3]

Lutie A. Lytle was one of the first African-American women to become a lawyer in the United States. [1]
