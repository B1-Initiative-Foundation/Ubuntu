George Franklin Grant was the second African American graduate of Harvard Dental School and the first African American faculty member at Harvard University. [3][4][5] He was born in [[Oswego]], [[New York]] in 1846 to formerly enslaved parents, [[Phillis Pitt Grant]] and [[Tudor Elandor Grant]]. [4] Grant's father had become a prominent barber in Oswego and Grant and his siblings had the advantage of attending a school where Black and white children were "equally admitted". [4]

In 1867, at the age of 21, Grant moved to [[Boston]], which was considered an epicenter of the American antislavery struggle. [4][5] He was hired as a laboratory assistant at the newly established [[Harvard Dental School]] and was invited to attend the school, graduating with distinction in 1870. [3][4][5] 

Grant was a pioneer in treating patients with cleft palate, a congenital condition. He invented and patented a prosthetic device called the "oblate palate" to help patients speak and eat more normally. [3][4][5] In 1884, he was appointed as the first African American professor at [[Harvard University]] and the nation's first African American dental education faculty member. [3][4][5]

In addition to his work as a dentist and professor, Grant was also an inventor. He is credited with inventing the modern wooden golf tee, which he patented in 1899. [5] Grant left [[Harvard]] in 1890 to open his own successful dental practice, but remained connected to the school as an alumnus. [5] He passed away in 1910 at the age of 64 due to liver disease.
