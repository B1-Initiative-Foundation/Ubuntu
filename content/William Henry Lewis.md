Here is a concise biography of William Henry Lewis:

## Personal Life
William Henry Lewis was born in 1868 to former slave parents in Berkeley, Virginia. He attended the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute (now Virginia State University) before transferring to Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he excelled as a student and athlete, serving as captain of the football team.[1][2][3] After graduating from Amherst, Lewis attended Harvard Law School, where he continued to play football and was named to the All-American team in 1892 and 1893, becoming the first African American so honored.[2][3]

## Career
After passing the Massachusetts bar in 1895, Lewis practiced law in Boston and became involved in local politics, serving on the Cambridge City Council from 1899 to 1901 and being elected to the Massachusetts legislature, though he lost his bid for re-election.[5] Lewis's legal skills and connections led to his appointment as assistant U.S. attorney in Boston in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt, the first African American to hold such a position.[2][3] In 1911, President William Howard Taft appointed Lewis as assistant attorney general of the United States, the first African American to hold a sub-cabinet position.[3][4]

## Achievements
In addition to his pioneering role as one of the first African American college football players and coaches, Lewis was a respected lawyer who fought against racial discrimination, including pressing for a law that prohibited barber shops from refusing service to Black customers.[5] He was also active in Republican politics and defended unpopular cases related to bootlegging, corruption, and racial discrimination during the 1920s.[3][4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
There is no evidence of Lewis being involved in any major controversies or holding racist, homophobic, or antisemitic views. However, he did testify against other Black activists, including William Monroe Trotter, at a National Negro Business League meeting, which drew some criticism from liberal Black Americans at the time.[3]

## Bibliography
Lewis did not author any books, but he published several short stories, including "I Got Somebody in Staunton", which was recognized as a Fiction Honor Book by the Black Caucus of the American Library Association and was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Prize for Fiction.[1]
