Though he could have passed for white, Hope dedicated his life to the advancement of African Americans through higher education. [1][2][3][4][5]

After his father's death when he was 8, Hope had to leave school after 8th grade to work and support his family. But he later returned to education, attending [[Worcester Academy]] and then graduating from [[Brown University]] in 1894. [3][4]

In 1906, he became the first African American president of Morehouse, a position he held until 1929. [1][2][3][4][5]

In 1929, Hope was selected as the first African American president of [[Atlanta University]], where he worked to develop the institution's graduate programs to provide higher education for Black students. He was active in national civil rights organizations like the [[Niagara Movement]], [[NAACP]], and the [[Commission on Interracial Cooperation]]. [1][2][3][4][5]

Hope passed away in 1936 at the age of 67 from pneumonia. He left a lasting legacy as a pioneering African American educator and leader in the fight for civil rights. [1][2][3][4][5]

## Personal Life

John Hope was born on June 2, 1868 in Augusta, Georgia to a biracial couple. His father, James Hope, was a Scottish immigrant and successful businessman, while his mother, Mary Frances Butts, was a free African American woman. Although interracial marriage was prohibited in Georgia at the time, Hope's parents lived openly as husband and wife until his father's death in 1876.[1][2][3] 

After his father's passing, Hope's position as part of the Black elite was threatened, as the executors of his father's estate failed to carry out his plans to provide financial security for the family. Despite this setback, Hope was able to complete his education, attending Worcester Academy in Massachusetts and later earning a B.A. degree from Brown University in 1894.[1][2][3]

In 1897, Hope married Lugenia Burns, who would also become a prominent race leader and social activist.[1][3]

## Career

After graduating from Brown, Hope began his career as an educator, first teaching science at Roger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1898, he moved to Atlanta, where he took a teaching position at Atlanta Baptist College (later Morehouse College).[1][2][3] 

In 1906, Hope became the first African American president of Morehouse College, a position he held until 1929.[1][2][3] During his tenure, he worked to develop the college and support public education, housing, healthcare, and job opportunities for Black Americans.

In 1929, Hope was selected as the first African American president of Atlanta University, where he focused on building the university's graduate programs to ensure higher education for Black scholars.[1][2][3] Under his leadership, Atlanta University launched a graduate school, established a Department of Fine Arts, and opened the Trevor Arnett Library.

## Achievements

Hope was a prominent figure in the early 20th century civil rights movement. He was a member of the Niagara Movement, a forerunner to the NAACP, and was involved with the National Urban League, the YMCA, and the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools.[1][3] 

In 1936, Hope was awarded the NAACP's Spingarn Medal for his contributions to the advancement of African Americans.[2][4] He was also invited as the Convention Speaker for Alpha Phi Alpha's Silver Anniversary convention in Nashville, Tennessee.[2]

After his death in 1936, Hope's legacy continued to be honored. The SS John Hope, a Liberty ship, was named after him in 1944.[2] Several schools, including John Hope College Preparatory High School in Chicago and Hope-Hill Elementary School in Atlanta, were also named in his honor.[2]
