Harry James Green, Jr. was the first African American to earn a doctoral degree in chemical engineering in the United States. [1] He earned his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from [[The Ohio State University]] in 1932 and his Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the same institution in 1943, becoming the first African American to achieve this milestone. [1]

During the Great Depression, Green faced significant challenges in finding employment as an engineer, but he secured a position as a chemistry instructor at [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College]]. [1] He later earned a master's degree from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1938 and returned to North Carolina A&T as a full professor. [1]

In 1944, Green joined [[Stromberg-Carlson]], a telecommunications equipment and electronics manufacturer in [[Rochester]], [[New York]], as a senior engineer. [1] He made significant contributions to the company, including solving a problem with obtaining a special carbon needed for telephone transmitters. [1] Green later worked at [[Xerox Corporation]] in the research department, retiring in 1976. [1]

Throughout his career, Green was recognized for his achievements and contributions. He was a member of several honor societies, including [[Phi Eta Sigma]], [[Phi Lambda Upsilon]], and [[Sigma Xi]], as well as the [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity.
