Donald Gaines Murray was an American attorney who was the first African-American to enter the University of Maryland School of Law since 1890, as a result of winning the landmark civil rights case Murray v. Pearson in 1935. [1][3][4] Murray sought admission to the University of Maryland School of Law in 1935, but his application was rejected on account of his race. He then worked with lawyers at Howard University, including Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP, to file a lawsuit against the university. [1][3][4] The judge ruled in Murray's favor, ordering the university to admit him, and the ruling was upheld on appeal. [1][3][4] Murray went on to practice law in Baltimore and was involved in several subsequent cases that led to the desegregation of other graduate programs at the University of Maryland. [1][3][4] He retired in the early 1970s and died at the age of 72 in 1986. [3][4]
