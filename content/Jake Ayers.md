In 1975, Ayers alleged that the state of Mississippi, the [[Mississippi Board of Trustees of the State Institutions of Higher Learning]], and the predominantly white universities were using nearly a dozen policies and practices to prop up a dual system of higher education - one for Black students and one for white students. [1][2][3] 

After years of negotiations, the case went to trial in 1982. In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that Mississippi had to eliminate any policy or practice that was a vestige of segregation and contributed to the "racial identifiability" of the state's universities. [2][3]

It would take another 10 years for the state of Mississippi and the plaintiffs to agree on how to address the issues raised by the Supreme Court. In 2002, the case was finally settled, with the state agreeing to provide $503 million in funding over 17 years to the state's historically Black public universities to help root out remnants of the dual, segregated system. [2][3]

Jake Ayers was a civil rights veteran from Glen Allan, Mississippi who filed a landmark lawsuit in 1975 against the state of Mississippi for providing inadequate resources to its historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). [1]

The Ayers v. Fordice lawsuit, later renamed Ayers v. Musgrove, sought to correct the gross inequities in funding and educational opportunities between Mississippi's HBCUs and its predominantly white institutions. [1] The case eventually led to a $503 million settlement in 2002 to enhance the state's three public HBCUs - Jackson State University, Alcorn State University, and Mississippi Valley State University. [1]

While the settlement provided significant financial resources, some plaintiffs, including Ayers' widow Lillie, felt the enhancements were still not enough for the HBCUs to truly compete with the state's white institutions. They also criticized the condition that the HBCUs achieve 10% non-Black enrollment for three consecutive years to receive the full endowment funds. [1]

Jake Ayers passed away in 1986, but his legacy as a civil rights pioneer and advocate for educational equity lives on. The Ayers v. Fordice case is considered a landmark victory in the fight for desegregation and equal funding for HBCUs. [1]
