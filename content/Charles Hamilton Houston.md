Charles Hamilton Houston was a pioneering African American lawyer and civil rights leader who played a pivotal role in dismantling racial segregation in the United States. Here is a summary of his life and accomplishments:

## Personal Life
Charles Hamilton Houston was born on September 3, 1895 in Washington, D.C. to a middle-class African American family. His father, William Le Pré Houston, was an attorney, and his mother, Mary Ethel Hamilton Houston, was a seamstress. Houston attended the segregated M Street High School (later renamed Dunbar High School) and graduated at the age of 15. He then attended Amherst College, where he was the only Black student in his class, and graduated magna cum laude in 1915 as the valedictorian. [1][2][3]

## Career
After teaching at Howard University for two years, Houston joined the U.S. Army during World War I, serving as a First Lieutenant. His experiences with racism in the military further motivated him to pursue a career in law and civil rights. [1][3] 

Houston attended Harvard Law School, where he excelled academically and became the first Black student to serve on the Harvard Law Review. He earned his Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) degree in 1923, the first African American to do so at Harvard. [4]

In 1924, Houston joined his father's law firm, which was one of the first Black-owned law firms in Washington, D.C. He then became the first special counsel for the NAACP, leading the organization's legal strategy to challenge racial segregation. [1][2][3]

## Achievements
As the dean of Howard University Law School from 1929 to 1935, Houston trained a generation of Black lawyers, including Thurgood Marshall, who would go on to play key roles in the civil rights movement. [1][2] 

Houston's legal work was instrumental in several landmark Supreme Court cases that dismantled the "separate but equal" doctrine, including Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada (1938) and Shelley v. Kraemer (1948). He is often referred to as the "architect of the Brown v. Board of Education decision" for his work laying the groundwork for that historic 1954 ruling. [1][2][4]
