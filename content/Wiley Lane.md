Wiley Lane was born in 1852 in [[Elizabeth City]], [[North Carolina]] to free Black parents.[1][4] He attended the college preparatory department at [[Howard University]] before enrolling at [[Amherst College]] from 1877 to 1879, where he studied classical literature and culture.[1][2][4] 

After leaving Amherst, Lane returned to [[Howard University]] where he became a professor of Greek in 1883.[1][2][4] Tragically, he died of pneumonia in February 1885 at the young age of 32.[1][4] At his funeral, [[Rev. William Patton]], the President of [[Howard University]], praised Lane's remarkable accomplishments, noting that he "began life as a colored child in a slave State, at the very bottom of society, and he died professor of Greek in a university established by Congress in the National Capitol."[1][5]

Wiley Lane was a prominent African American scholar and professor who attended Amherst College in the late 19th century. According to the search results:

Wiley Lane was born in 1852 in Elizabeth City, North Carolina to free parents Whitmel and Mary L. Lane. [1] He attended the Pasquotank Colored Normal School in 1869 and then the College Preparatory Department at Howard University from 1870-1877, graduating summa cum laude. [1] 

Lane then went on to attend Amherst College, graduating in 1879 with a Bachelor's degree. [1][3] During his time at Amherst, Lane gained extensive knowledge of Greek and Latin, which he would later use in his career. [3]

After graduating from Amherst, Lane returned to Washington D.C. and was appointed as a professor in the Normal Department at Howard University in 1881. [1][2] He later became a Professor of Greek Language and Literature at Howard, a position he held until his sudden death from pneumonia in 1885 at the age of 32. [1][2]

The search results highlight Lane's academic achievements, particularly his time at the prestigious Amherst College, where he was the first Black student to attend. [3] His expertise in Greek and Latin, gained during his studies at Amherst, allowed him to become the first Black professor of Greek at Howard University. [1][3] Lane's untimely death was mourned as a significant loss for both Howard University and the broader African American community. [1][2]
