He then served as the 25th president of Harvard University from 1971 to 1991, succeeding Nathan M. Pusey. During his presidency, Bok negotiated the "non-merger merger" between Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges in the mid-1970s.

He was the recipient of the 2001 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Education for his book "The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions", co-authored with former Princeton University president William G.
