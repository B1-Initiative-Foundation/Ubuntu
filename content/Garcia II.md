Here is a concise and accurate biography of King Garcia II of Kongo:

## Personal Life
Garcia II Nkanga a Lukeni was born in the early 17th century in the Kingdom of Kongo. He and his brother Álvaro Nimi attended the Jesuit college at São Salvador (modern M'banza-Kongo) starting in 1620, where they studied under the Jesuit priest João de Paiva. During his youth, Garcia obtained the nickname "Kipaku" ("Quipaco") of uncertain meaning.

## Career
In 1634, when King Álvaro V was threatened by Daniel da Silva, Duke of Mbamba, Garcia and his brother came to the king's aid. Garcia was particularly valiant during the battle, and was rewarded by being named Marquis of Kiova.

In 1636, Álvaro V sought to remove and execute the brothers, but they defeated and beheaded the king. Álvaro's brother Álvaro VI then crowned Garcia as the new King of Kongo in 1641.

As king, Garcia II immediately moved his armies south to assist the Dutch in driving the Portuguese out of Angola, as Kongo had a long-standing pact with the Dutch. He defeated attempts by the Portuguese and their local allies to overthrow him over the next several years.

Garcia turned his attention to internal affairs after the Dutch period, welcoming Capuchin missionaries in 1645 but later becoming suspicious of them and imprisoning the elderly Queen Leonor in 1652 for an alleged plot, causing him to lose public confidence.

## Achievements
Garcia II is considered one of Kongo's greatest kings for his religious piety and near expulsion of the Portuguese from Angola. However, he is also notorious for enriching himself through his leading role in the Atlantic slave trade.

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
While Garcia II was a devout Catholic, he became increasingly suspicious of the Capuchin missionaries and imprisoned the respected Queen Leonor, causing him to lose public support. He also played a major role in the Atlantic slave trade, enriching himself through this controversial practice.

Garcia II was the king of the Kingdom of Kongo from 1641 to 1661. [1] He is considered one of Kongo's greatest kings for his religious piety, but is also known for his leading role in the Atlantic slave trade. [1][4][5]

Garcia II was born in the early 17th century and attended the Jesuit college in the Kongo capital of São Salvador (modern M'banza-Kongo) as a youth, where he studied with the Jesuit priest João de Paiva. [1] In 1634, Garcia and his brother Álvaro came to the aid of King Álvaro V when he was threatened by the Duke of Mbamba, and were rewarded with noble titles. [1] However, in 1636 Álvaro V sought to remove and execute the brothers, leading them to defeat and behead the king. Álvaro was then crowned King Álvaro VI and named Garcia as Duke of Mbamba. [1]

On 22 January 1641, Álvaro VI died under mysterious circumstances, and before an election could be held, Garcia forcibly became king. [1] Shortly after, the Dutch invaded and took the Portuguese colony of Luanda, and Garcia immediately moved his armies south to assist the Dutch, as Kongo had a long-term pact to help drive the Portuguese out of Angola. [1] Over the following years, Garcia defeated attempts by rivals to overthrow him, and by 1657 had annihilated or absorbed all of the House of Nsundi. [1] Garcia died in 1660, leaving his second son António I of Kongo to succeed him. [1]
