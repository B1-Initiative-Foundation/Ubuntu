Alice Coachman was a pioneering African-American athlete who became the first Black woman from any country to win an Olympic gold medal. She achieved this historic feat at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, setting a record in the high jump with a leap of 5 feet, 6 1/8 inches. Growing up in the segregated South, Coachman faced numerous obstacles, including limited access to training facilities and organized sports events. Despite these challenges, she improvised her training and excelled in athletics, eventually catching the attention of the Tuskegee Institute, which offered her a scholarship. Throughout her career, Coachman dominated the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) competitions, winning ten national championships in the high jump consecutively from 1939 to 1948. She also excelled in sprinting and was a member of Tuskegee Institute's national champion 4x100m relay teams in 1941 and 1942. After her Olympic victory, Coachman returned to the United States, where she was celebrated, though she still faced the realities of segregation. After retiring from athletics, Coachman dedicated herself to education and community service. She founded the Alice Coachman Track and Field Foundation to support young athletes and retired Olympic competitors in financial need. Coachman's legacy as a trailblazer in athletics and her contributions to breaking racial barriers in sports have been recognized through her induction into multiple halls of fame, including the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame
