## Career
Washington began his acting career collaborating with director Spike Lee on several films in the 1990s, including Crooklyn, Clockers, Girl 6, and Get on the Bus.[4] He went on to appear in other films such as Love Jones, Bulworth, Out of Sight, True Crime, Romeo Must Die, Exit Wounds, Ghost Ship, and Hollywood Homicide.[4] In 2005, Washington landed his breakthrough role as Dr. Preston Burke on the hit TV series Grey's Anatomy.[4] However, he was dismissed from the show after the third season due to his use of a homophobic slur towards a co-star.[1][3][4] From 2014 to 2018, Washington portrayed Thelonious Jaha on the TV series The 100.[4] In 2020, he began hosting a travel and cooking show called Isaiah Washington: Kitchen Talk on Fox Nation.[4] In 2022, Washington made his directorial debut with the film Corsicana, which he also co-wrote and starred in.[4]

## Achievements
Washington has received several awards and nominations for his acting work, including 4 wins and 8 nominations.[5] In 2005, he discovered through a DNA test that his maternal ancestry can be traced to Sierra Leone, and he has since become a visible supporter of the African nation, being given the title of village chief and the name Gondobay Manga II.[4] He has also started a foundation to help build a school in Sierra Leone and worked to bring wells, medical supplies, and foreign investment there.[4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
In 2007, Washington was fired from Grey's Anatomy after using a homophobic slur towards his co-star T.R. Knight.[1][3][4] This incident sparked controversy and debate around issues of race and forgiveness in Hollywood. Washington has since expressed political alignment with the Republican Party and endorsed Jill Stein for President in 2016, though he has since become a member of the #WalkAway movement.[4]

## Bibliography
Washington has not authored any books, but he did write a book called A Man from Another Land which chronicles his early life, acting career, and search for his roots after a DNA test revealed his ancestors came from Sierra Leone.[4]
