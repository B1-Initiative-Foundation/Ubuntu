Elbert Frank Cox was an American mathematician who was the first Black person to receive a PhD in mathematics, which he earned at [[Cornell University]] in 1925. [1][2][3] He was born in [[Evansville]], [[Indiana]] and studied at [[Indiana University]], where he excelled academically despite facing racial discrimination. [1][3] After serving in World War I, Cox taught at several institutions before being accepted into the doctoral program at [[Cornell University]] in 1921. [1][3] He completed his dissertation on polynomial solutions to a difference equation and went on to have a career as a professor at [[West Virginia State College]] and [[Howard University]], where he served as the head of the mathematics department. [1][3] Though he did not receive much recognition during his lifetime, Cox is now celebrated as a pioneer and trailblazer for African Americans in mathematics. [1][2]

Here is a concise biography of Elbert Frank Cox, based on the search results provided:

## Personal Life
Elbert Frank Cox was born on December 5, 1895 in Evansville, Indiana to Johnson D. Cox and Eugenia Talbot Cox. He grew up in a racially mixed neighborhood, but attended segregated schools that provided inadequate resources for Black students. Despite the racial tensions in Evansville at the time, Cox's family remained in the city and his father served as a principal and educator for many years.[1][5] 

## Career
After graduating from Indiana University in 1917 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics, Cox briefly taught high school in Kentucky before serving in the U.S. Army during World War I from 1918 to 1919. He then taught at Shaw University in North Carolina from 1919 to 1922.[1][2][3]

In 1922, Cox was awarded a scholarship to pursue a PhD in mathematics at Cornell University. He became the first African American to earn a doctoral degree in mathematics in 1925, with his thesis on "Polynomial solutions of difference equations".[1][2][3][4]

After earning his PhD, Cox was appointed as an associate professor of mathematics at Howard University, where he taught for over 40 years until his retirement in 1965.[1][2][3] 

## Achievements
Cox's achievement of becoming the first African American to earn a PhD in mathematics was groundbreaking, as it paved the way for other Black mathematicians like Dudley Welcon Woodard, William Waldron Shiefflin Claytor, Marjorie Lee Browne, Evelyn Boyd Granville and David Blackwell to also receive their doctorates.[1][2]

In 1975, Howard University established the Elbert F. Cox Scholarship Fund to help Black students pursue graduate studies in mathematics, in honor of Cox's pioneering accomplishments.[1][2][3][4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
