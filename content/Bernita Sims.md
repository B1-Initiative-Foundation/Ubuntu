Bernita Sims was the mayor of High Point, North Carolina. She was elected in November 2012 and served as the city's first African American mayor until her resignation in September 2014.[1][2][5]

## Personal Life
Sims was a native of High Point, North Carolina and attended High Point City Schools, completing her senior year of high school in Seat Pleasant, Maryland. She went on to attend the University of the District of Columbia, where she studied communications.[3]

## Career
Sims served on the High Point City Council from December 2003 to December 2012, where she held various leadership roles such as liaison to the High Point Museum Board, the Human Relations Commission, and chair of the Public Services Committee.[3] She was elected mayor pro-tem by her fellow council members in 2005 and served a one-year term.[3]

## Controversies
In November 2013, Sims was indicted by a Guilford County grand jury for allegedly writing a worthless $7,000 check as part of an estate settlement.[1][2] The indictment stated that Sims "unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did draw, make, utter or issue and deliver to [Annie Ponce]" a check that she knew did not have sufficient funds.[1][2] Sims pleaded guilty to the felony worthless check charge in September 2014 and resigned as mayor.[1][2] She was sentenced to a suspended 4-14 month sentence, 5 years probation, and a $500 fine, and had already made a $7,000 restitution payment.[1]
