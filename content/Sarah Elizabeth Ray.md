In 1945, Sarah Elizabeth Ray was denied passage on a ferry operated by the Bob-Lo Excursion Company on the Detroit River because she was Black. She fought the injustice, and her case went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in her favor in 1948.[1][2][3][4] Her case was a precursor to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, which found that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.[2][3] 

After the court case, Ray went on to create the Action House in Detroit, a community center that helped empower Black youth and promote interracial solidarity.[2][4] She was a lifelong advocate for education and civil rights, and was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2021.[2]

Sarah Elizabeth Ray was a civil rights activist who gained prominence in 1945 after being denied entry to the Boblo Boat, a ferry that transported people to the Boblo Island Amusement Park in Detroit. 

## Personal Life
Sarah Elizabeth Ray was born Elizabeth Cole in 1921. She married her first husband, Frank Ray, in 1936 and moved to Detroit during the Great Migration. In the 1940s, she started going by her middle name, Elizabeth, and later married Rafael Haskell, going by Elizabeth Haskell or Lizz Haskell. [3]

## Boblo Boat Incident
In 1945, when Ray was 24 years old, she was with her white classmates from secretarial school when the ticket taker on the Boblo Boat saw that she was Black and denied her entry. Ray contacted the NAACP and, with the help of future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, sued the Boblo Excursion Company. She won her case all the way up to the Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court's ruling that the company's segregation policies were unconstitutional. [1][2]

## Legacy
Ray's case is often cited as setting the precedent for the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, which desegregated public schools. She is referred to as "Detroit's other Rosa Parks" for her role in fighting segregation. [5]

After her death, Ray's former home in Detroit fell into disrepair, but it was recently designated as one of the country's "11 Most Endangered Historic Sites" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The home is now being preserved and turned into a museum and community space to honor Ray's legacy. [2][5]
