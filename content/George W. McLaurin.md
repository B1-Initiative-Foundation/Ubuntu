George W. McLaurin was the successful plaintiff in the landmark civil rights case McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents (1950), which enabled African Americans to be admitted to graduate education at the University of Oklahoma on a desegregated basis.[1][2][3] Despite being admitted, McLaurin was initially forced to sit in segregated areas of classrooms, the cafeteria, and the library, which he challenged in a subsequent lawsuit that was ultimately ruled in his favor by the Supreme Court.[2][3] McLaurin's case was influential in the eventual overturning of the "separate but equal" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson.[2][3] After his Supreme Court victory, McLaurin dropped his pursuit of his education at the University of Oklahoma, though his legacy lives on through an annual conference and memorial lounge named in his honor.[1][3]

George W. McLaurin was the first African-American student admitted to the University of Oklahoma. He was the successful plaintiff in the landmark civil rights case McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, which challenged the university's segregation policies.

## Personal Life
McLaurin was born on September 16, 1887 in Oklahoma. He earned a bachelor's degree from Langston University and a master's degree from the University of Kansas. Before retiring, he taught at the predominantly black Langston University. [3][5]

## Career
In 1948, McLaurin applied and was accepted into the University of Oklahoma's doctoral program in education. However, the university required him to be completely segregated from white students, forcing him to sit in an anteroom next to the classroom, eat at a separate table in the cafeteria, and use separate restroom facilities. [1][2][3][4]

## Achievements
McLaurin challenged these discriminatory policies in the landmark Supreme Court case McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents. In 1950, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Oklahoma's segregation of McLaurin violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. This was an important precedent in the civil rights movement, as it helped pave the way for the eventual overturning of the "separate but equal" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson. [1][2][3][4][5]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
There is no evidence that McLaurin was involved with any racist, homophobic, or antisemitic views or organizations. The sources indicate he was a pioneering civil rights figure who challenged segregation in higher education. [1][2][3][4][5]
