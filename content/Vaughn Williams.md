Vaughn Williams was the first Black president of the Stanford Law Review, making Stanford the first top law school to break that barrier.[1] He was one of the first graduates of the Stanford Black Law Student Association (BLSA), which was established in 1970 at the law school.[1] Along with Leroy Bobbit and Sallyanne Peyton, Vaughn Williams was part of the first group of Black graduates from Stanford Law School.[1]

Based on the search results provided, here is the answer to the question:

Vaughn Williams was the first African-American to serve as president of the Stanford Law Review. [1][3] He was elected to this position while attending Stanford Law School, making Stanford the first top law school to have an African-American president of its law review. [3] Williams' tenure as president of the Stanford Law Review was seen as great preparation for his future government service. [1]

The search results indicate that Vaughn Williams was part of an "amazing class" at Stanford Law School in the late 1960s, and that he and Maya Harris (who later became his wife) were close friends during their time at the law school. [1] The sources also note that Williams went on to have a successful legal career after graduating from Stanford.
