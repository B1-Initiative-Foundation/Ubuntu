Marian Wright Edelman is an American activist who has dedicated her life to advocating for civil rights and children's rights. Here is a summary of her life and achievements:

## Personal Life
Marian Wright Edelman was born on June 6, 1939 in Bennettsville, South Carolina. Her father was a Baptist minister who encouraged her education before passing away when she was 14 years old. Edelman attended Marlboro Training High School and then Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, where she graduated as valedictorian in 1960. [1][2]

## Career
After graduating from Yale Law School in 1963, Edelman became the first African-American woman admitted to the Mississippi Bar. She worked as a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, fighting for racial justice and civil rights. [1][2] 

In 1968, Edelman moved to Washington D.C. and became counsel for Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign. She founded the Washington Research Project, a public interest law firm, and in 1973 she established the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), which has become a leading advocate for children's rights. [3][4]

## Achievements
Under Edelman's leadership, the CDF has been instrumental in securing legislation like the 1990 Act for Better Child Care, which brought over $3 billion in funding for childcare programs. She has authored several influential books on children's issues. Edelman has received numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2000 and the Robert F. Kennedy Lifetime Achievement Award for her writings. [2][3][4]
