Here is a concise biography of Oliver O. Howard:

## Personal Life
Oliver Otis Howard was born on November 8, 1830 in Leeds, Maine to Rowland Bailey Howard and Eliza Otis Howard.[3] His great-grandfather, Rogers Stinchfield, and great-granduncle, Thomas Stinchfield, founded the town of Leeds.[3] Howard attended several schools in Maine, including Monmouth Academy, North Yarmouth Academy, and Kents Hill School, before graduating from Bowdoin College in 1850 at the age of 19.[3] In 1855, he married Elizabeth Anne Waite, with whom he had seven children.[3]

## Career
After graduating from Bowdoin, Howard attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating fourth in his class in 1854.[3][5] He served in the U.S. Army, including a stint fighting the Seminole Indians in Florida in 1857, where he underwent a religious conversion to evangelical Christianity.[2][3][5] 

At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Howard resigned his regular army commission to become colonel of the 3rd Maine Volunteer Infantry regiment.[3][5] He was promoted to brigadier general in 1861 and led a brigade in the Army of the Potomac, losing his right arm in the Battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines in 1862.[3][5] Despite this injury, Howard continued to serve, eventually reaching the rank of major general.[3][5] He suffered defeats at the Battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg in 1863, but later commanded corps and armies in the Western Theater, including during Sherman's March to the Sea.[2][3][5]

After the war, Howard was appointed as the first commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau, tasked with integrating freed slaves into Southern society during Reconstruction.[1][2][4] He founded Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1867 and served as its president from 1869 to 1874.[1][4] Howard later commanded troops in the West, including campaigns against the Nez Perce tribe led by Chief Joseph.[2][5]

## Achievements
Howard received the Medal of Honor in 1893 for his bravery at the Battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines.[3][5] He was also instrumental in the founding of Howard University and Lincoln Memorial University.[1][4][5] However, his leadership of the Freedmen's Bureau was criticized for mismanagement and corruption, despite his efforts to help freed slaves.[2]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Howard's military career was marked by several high-profile defeats, including at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, which led to him being derisively nicknamed "Uh Oh" or "Oh Oh" Howard by his own troops.[2] He was also criticized for his harsh treatment of Native American tribes, particularly the Nez Perce, during his campaigns in the West after the Civil War.[2]
