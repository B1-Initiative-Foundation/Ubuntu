Joseph Lieberman was an American attorney and politician who was a longtime member of the U.S. Senate from Connecticut, serving from 1989 to 2013. [1][2][3][4] He was originally elected as a Democrat, but later won reelection in 2006 as an independent after losing the Democratic Party primary. [2][3] In 2000, he was the Democratic vice presidential nominee, becoming the first Jewish candidate on the national ticket of a major U.S. political party. [1][2][3][4] 

Lieberman studied at Yale University, where he earned both a B.A. (1964) and an LL.B. (1967). [1] He was active in the civil rights movement during the 1960s and briefly practiced law before entering politics. [1] Lieberman was elected to the Connecticut Senate in 1970 and served as majority leader from 1975 to 1981. [1] He was elected Connecticut attorney general in 1982 and then won election to the U.S. Senate in 1988, becoming the first Orthodox Jew to sit in that body. [1][2]

In the Senate, Lieberman took a generally centrist stance, supporting Democratic positions on issues like campaign finance reform, abortion rights, and gun control, while also advocating for some conservative causes such as school vouchers and limits on liability awards. [1][2] He was a vocal critic of President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. [1][2] 

After losing the Democratic primary for his Senate seat in 2006, Lieberman ran and won as an independent, attracting support from both Democrats and Republicans. [2][3] He later endorsed Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008, further distancing himself from the Democratic Party. [3][4] Lieberman retired from the Senate in 2013 and remained active in politics, including efforts to mount a third-party presidential ticket in 2024. [3][4] He passed away on March 27, 2024, at the age of 82. [2][4][5]
