Elizabeth Evelyn Wright was an African-American educator and social reformer who founded Voorhees College in Denmark, South Carolina. [1][2][3][4]

## Personal Life
Wright was born on April 3, 1872 in Talbotton, Georgia to John Wesley Wright, an African-American carpenter, and Virginia Rolfe, a full-blooded Cherokee. [2] She was raised in poverty but was determined to receive an education. At the age of 16, she left home and traveled to Tuskegee, Alabama, where she enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute. [1][2] While at Tuskegee, she was inspired by the educational philosophy of Booker T. Washington and worked as a domestic servant to support herself. [1][2] In 1906, she married fellow Tuskegee graduate and Voorhees College treasurer Martin Asabee Menafee. [2]

## Career
After completing her studies at Tuskegee, Wright returned to South Carolina and started teaching at the Macedonia School in Denmark. [1][2] Realizing the need for higher education opportunities for African Americans in the region, she embarked on a mission to establish a college. In 1897, she founded the Denmark Industrial School, which later became known as Voorhees Industrial School and eventually Voorhees College. [1][2][3][4] Voorhees College provided vocational training and academic education to African-American students, focusing on agriculture, carpentry, home economics, and other practical skills. [1][2] Wright believed that education should not only prepare students for employment but also instill character, discipline, and moral values. [1][2]

## Achievements
Wright's dedication to education and her tireless efforts to establish Voorhees College played a significant role in expanding educational opportunities for African Americans in South Carolina. [1][2][3][4] By 1900, the school had grown to serve 270 students, and in 1902 it was renamed Voorhees Industrial School to honor Ralph and Elizabeth Voorhees, who had provided funding for a 280-acre campus. [2][3] Voorhees College later became a fully accredited four-year college and continues to educate students to this day. [3]
