## Personal Life
Walter Francis White was born on July 1, 1893 in Atlanta, Georgia. He was the fourth of seven children born to George W. White, a postal worker, and Madeline Harrison White, a schoolteacher. White's family belonged to Atlanta's Black elite and attended the influential First Congregational Church.[1][2][3] Despite being very light-skinned, White chose to identify as African American, a decision that was solidified after witnessing the Atlanta race massacre in 1906 as a 13-year-old.[3][4]

White graduated from Atlanta University in 1916 and briefly worked as an insurance agent before becoming secretary of the Atlanta branch of the NAACP that same year.[1][3] In 1918, he moved to New York City at the invitation of NAACP executive director James Weldon Johnson and joined the national NAACP staff.[1][3] White married Leah Gladys (Powell) and they had one daughter, actress Jane White.[2]

## Career
As assistant secretary of the NAACP from 1918 to 1931, White conducted undercover investigations of lynchings and race riots across the South, using his light skin to infiltrate white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.[1][3][4] His research was published in his 1929 book "Rope and Faggot: A Biography of Judge Lynch", which became a major expos√© on lynching in the U.S.[1][3]

In 1931, White became the executive secretary of the NAACP, the highest position in the organization, a role he held until his death in 1955.[1][3][4] During his tenure, the NAACP led the fight for anti-lynching legislation and initiated legal battles to eliminate all-white primaries, poll taxes, and segregation.[1][3][4] White also worked with labor leader A. Philip Randolph to persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial discrimination in defense industries and established the Fair Employment Practices Commission.[1][3]

## Achievements
White received the Harmon Award in 1927 for his book "Rope and Faggot" and the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP in 1937 for outstanding achievement.[5] In 2002, he was listed as one of the "100 Greatest African Americans" by Molefi Kete Asante, and in 2009 he was inducted into the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame.[5] White's advocacy and leadership were instrumental in the NAACP's successes during the civil rights movement of the 1940s and 1950s.[1][3][4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
There is no evidence of White being involved in any controversies, racist, homophobic, or antisemitic comments, or relationships with hate groups. His interracial marriage to a white woman, Poppy Cannon, in 1949 was controversial at the time, but the NAACP leadership ultimately defended his right to do so.[4]
