David Jones Peck was the first African American to graduate from an American medical school, completing his studies at Rush Medical College in Chicago in 1847.[1][2] He was born to prominent abolitionist and minister John C. Peck and his wife Sarah in Carlisle, Pennsylvania around 1826.[1][2] 

Peck's early education took place at a school for black children established by his parents in Pittsburgh, where the family moved in 1837.[1] He later studied medicine under Dr. Joseph P. Gaszzam in Pittsburgh before entering Rush Medical College in 1846.[1][2] 

During his time at Rush, Peck faced opposition from some fellow students, but the faculty supported his enrollment.[1] After graduating in 1847, Peck toured Ohio with abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass.[1][2] He then established a medical practice in Philadelphia, but it was not successful as he faced discrimination from other doctors.[2]

In 1852, Peck joined an emigration project led by Martin Delany to resettle free African Americans in Nicaragua.[2] Peck practiced medicine and became the town physician of San Juan Del Norte.[2] In 1854, he joined the Liberal side in the Nicaraguan Civil War and was killed by cannon fire in the town of Granada in January 1855.[2]

Here is a concise biography of David Jones Peck:

## Personal Life
David Jones Peck was born around 1826 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania to Sarah Jones Peck and John C. Peck, a prominent abolitionist and minister in the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church. [1][2] The Peck family later moved to Pittsburgh, where John Peck founded the first school for Black children in the area. [2] David Peck studied medicine under the tutelage of Dr. Joseph P. Gazzam, a white anti-slavery physician, from 1844 to 1846. [3]

## Career
In 1846, Peck entered Rush Medical College in Chicago, becoming the first African American to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from an American medical school when he graduated in 1847. [1][2][3] After graduating, Peck toured Ohio with abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass. [2] He then set up a medical practice in Philadelphia in 1848, but it was not successful as few doctors recognized his status. [2] In 1852, Peck moved to San Juan del Norte, Nicaragua at the suggestion of Martin R. Delany. [2]

## Achievements
Peck's achievement of becoming the first African American to earn a medical degree was used by abolitionists to promote the idea of full Black citizenship and attack slavery. [2] In Nicaragua, Peck chaired a convention that elected Delany as mayor of Greytown and commander-in-chief of the military forces. [4]
