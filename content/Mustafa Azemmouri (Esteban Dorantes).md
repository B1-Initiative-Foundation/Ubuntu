Mustafa Azemmouri, also known as Estevanico or Esteban, was a Moroccan explorer who is considered the first African to explore the American Southwest. Born around 1500 in Azemmour, Morocco, he was captured as a youth and sold into slavery to the Spanish nobleman Andrés Dorantes de Carranza[1][2]. Dorantes renamed him Estevanico and converted him to Christianity[3][4].

In 1527, Azemmouri accompanied the Narváez expedition to establish a colony in North America[4]. After a shipwreck near Galveston, Texas, he was one of only four survivors who embarked on an eight-year journey across the Southwest, becoming the first African to enter the American West[2][3][4]. 

In 1539, Azemmouri was chosen by the Viceroy of New Spain to guide a return expedition to the Pueblo lands, where he was reported to have been killed by the A:shiwi (Zuni) people at the village of Hawikku[2][4][5]. The exact circumstances of his death remain uncertain, with various theories suggesting he may have been mistaken for an evil sorcerer, impersonated a medicine man, or even faked his own death to gain freedom[2][4][5].

Azemmouri's remarkable journey and mysterious disappearance have made him a figure of historical significance, with his story inspiring various works of fiction and media representations[2][4]. Despite the limited historical accounts, he is recognized as the first non-Native to explore the American Southwest and a pioneering figure in the early European exploration of the Americas[2][4][5].
