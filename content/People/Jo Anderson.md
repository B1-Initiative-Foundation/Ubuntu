## Jo Anderson
Jo Anderson was an enslaved person born in 1808 on the McCormick plantation in Rockbridge County, [[Virginia]], [[United States]]. He is credited as a major contributor to the design and creation of the mechanical reaper, a revolutionary invention in American agriculture that allowed crops to be gathered and collected mechanically rather than by hand.[1][3][4]

Jo Anderson worked closely with Cyrus McCormick, the son of inventor Robert McCormick, to perfect the mechanical reaper design. In 1831, Anderson and McCormick debuted their version of the reaper, which was later patented in 1834.[1][3] Cyrus McCormick's grandson later wrote that Anderson "deserves honor as the man who worked beside him in the building of the reaper" and that the two were "more like brothers than slave and master".[3] After the Civil War, McCormick freed Anderson but he could not live freely in Virginia, so he worked for neighboring farmers, with McCormick paying him a portion of the wages.[3][4]

Based on the search results, Jo Anderson was a slave who made significant contributions to the design and creation of the McCormick mechanical reaper, a revolutionary agricultural invention that transformed American farming in the 19th century:

## Personal Life
Jo Anderson was born into slavery in 1808 on the McCormick family's Walnut Grove plantation in Virginia. He was given as a companion to the young Cyrus McCormick, and the two grew up together, working closely on the development of the reaper.[1][4][5]

## Career
Anderson worked alongside Cyrus McCormick in refining the reaper design and building the first working prototype that was publicly demonstrated in 1831.[1][4][5] Though the patent for the reaper was issued to Cyrus McCormick in 1834, historians and McCormick family members acknowledge that Anderson deserves credit as a co-inventor for his crucial contributions.[1][3][4][5]

## Achievements
The McCormick mechanical reaper, which Anderson helped create, was a revolutionary invention that dramatically increased the efficiency of harvesting crops. It could cut more wheat in a day than six farmhands working by hand.[1][4] The reaper went on to be mass-produced and distributed by the McCormick family, becoming a foundational technology for modern agriculture.[1][4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Due to the nature of slavery at the time, Anderson's contributions were largely erased from the historical record. As an enslaved person, he was not able to receive a patent or formal recognition for his work on the reaper.[4] However, later accounts by the McCormick family and historians have worked to restore Anderson's rightful place as a co-inventor of this important agricultural innovation.[1][3][4][5]
