Hamilton Earl Holmes was one of the first two African American students to desegregate the University of Georgia (UGA) in 1961[1][2][3][4]. He was also the first Black student admitted to the Emory University School of Medicine in 1963[2][3]. Holmes was born in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia]] and excelled academically and athletically at [[Henry McNeal Turner High School]], graduating as valedictorian in 1959[2]. With the help of civil rights activist [[Jesse Hill]], Holmes and fellow Turner High graduate [[Charlayne Hunter-Gault]] applied to UGA, which initially rejected their applications[1][2]. After a legal battle, a federal judge ruled in 1961 that Holmes and Hunter-Gault were "fully qualified for immediate admission" and should be allowed to enroll[1][2]. Despite facing racial hostility on campus, Holmes went on to graduate from UGA in 1963 with honors[2][3]. He then became the first African American student admitted to Emory's medical school, earning his M.D. in 1967[2][3]. Holmes had a distinguished medical career, serving as chief of orthopedics at [[Grady Memorial Hospital]] and as a faculty member at Emory[3]. He is remembered as a trailblazer who helped desegregate higher education in Georgia[1][2][3][4].
