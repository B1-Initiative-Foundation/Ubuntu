Solomon Carter Fuller was a pioneering Liberian neurologist, psychiatrist, pathologist, and professor. He was the first African-American psychiatrist in the United States. Fuller made significant contributions to the study of Alzheimer's disease during his career. He also had a private practice as a physician, neurologist, and psychiatrist. [1][3]

Fuller was born in Monrovia, Liberia to Americo-Liberian parents of African American descent. He moved to the United States to study at Livingstone College in North Carolina, graduating in 1893. He then attended Boston University School of Medicine, earning his M.D. in 1897. [3]

After completing his medical degree, Fuller worked as a neuropathologist at Westborough State Hospital in Massachusetts. He traveled to Germany in 1904 to study with Emil Kraepelin and Alois Alzheimer, becoming one of only five foreign students accepted that year by Alzheimer. [1][3]

Fuller's work focused on the brain pathology of dementia and psychosis. He noted the similarities between presenile and senile dementia, which are now known as the plaques and tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. [1]

In 1919, Fuller joined the faculty at Boston University School of Medicine, where he taught pathology until his retirement in 1933. He continued his private practice as a physician, neurologist, and psychiatrist. [3]

Fuller faced significant racial discrimination throughout his career, receiving lower titles and salaries than his white colleagues. However, he was recognized as the first African-American psychiatrist in the United States, and the American Psychiatric Association now annually awards the Solomon Carter Fuller Award in his honor. [1][4]

## Personal Life

Solomon Carter Fuller was born on August 11, 1872 in Monrovia, Liberia to Americo-Liberian parents of African American descent. His father, Solomon, was a coffee planter and government official, while his mother, Anna Ursala (James) Fuller, came from a family of physicians and medical missionaries.[1][2][3] 

Fuller's paternal grandparents, John Lewis Fuller and his wife, had been slaves in Virginia. They bought their freedom and moved to Liberia in 1852 to help establish a settlement of African Americans.[2] Fuller's mother set up a school to teach him and other children in the area.[2]

In 1909, Fuller married Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller, an internationally known sculptor. They had three children together - Solomon C., William T., and Perry J. Fuller.[3]

## Career

After completing his college education at Livingstone College in North Carolina and earning his medical degree from Boston University School of Medicine in 1897, Fuller pursued further studies in psychiatry in Munich, Germany.[1][2][3] 

Upon returning to the United States, Fuller worked as a pathologist at Westborough State Hospital in Massachusetts, where he conducted research on Alzheimer's disease.[1][2] In 1919, he joined the faculty at Boston University School of Medicine as an associate professor of pathology and neurology, becoming the only African American on the faculty at the time.[1][2]

Fuller made significant contributions to the study of Alzheimer's disease. He was one of the five foreign researchers selected by Alois Alzheimer to work in his lab, and he helped translate Alzheimer's work from German to English.[1][2] Through his autopsies, Fuller discovered and reported on the neurofibrillary tangles in the brain tissue of people with dementia, which was a groundbreaking finding.[1]

## Achievements

In recognition of his pioneering work in Alzheimer's research, the Black Psychiatrists of America created the Solomon Carter Fuller Program in 1974 to assist young Black psychiatrists.[1] Additionally, the Solomon Carter Fuller Mental Health Center in Boston was named after him.[1][3]

Fuller also played a crucial role in correctly diagnosing and training young doctors to identify the side effects of syphilis, preventing Black war veterans from being misdiagnosed and denied military benefits.[3]
