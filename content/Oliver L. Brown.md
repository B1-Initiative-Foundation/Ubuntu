Here is a concise biography of Oliver L. Brown based on the search results:

## Personal Life
Oliver L. Brown was born on August 2, 1918 in Topeka, Kansas. He came from a poverty-stricken background and had a broken home as a child.[1] Brown overcame these challenges and became a welder for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and was studying to become a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.[1][2]

In 1950, Brown's oldest daughter Linda was denied admission to the all-white elementary school near their home and was forced to attend a segregated African-American school 24 blocks away.[2] This motivated Brown to join a class-action lawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education, which would become the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case.[2][3]

## Career
Brown was recruited by the local NAACP chapter, led by attorney Charles Scott, to be one of the 13 plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the Topeka school district.[2][3] Though he was not the first plaintiff alphabetically, Brown's name was used to represent the case, making him the lead plaintiff.[2] 

In 1959, Brown moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he served as pastor of the Benton Avenue A.M.E Church until his death.[2]

## Achievements
The Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case, filed under Brown's name, resulted in the landmark 1954 decision that declared state-sanctioned segregation of public schools unconstitutional, overturning the "separate but equal" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson.[2][3][4] This was a major milestone in the Civil Rights Movement.

## Death and Legacy
Oliver Brown died suddenly of a heart attack on June 20, 1961 at the age of 42 while traveling to Topeka.[2][3] His family, along with Topeka community members, later founded the nonprofit Brown Foundation for Educational Equity, Excellence and Research in 1988 to preserve his legacy.[3] In 1992, the former segregated Monroe Elementary School in Topeka was designated a National Historic Site.[3]
