James Farmer was an American civil rights activist and leader in the Civil Rights Movement. He co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in 1942 and served as its national chairman from 1942 to 1944. Farmer was known as one of the "Big Four" civil rights leaders in the 1960s, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Roy Wilkins, and Whitney Young. [1][4]

Farmer was the initiator and organizer of the first Freedom Ride in 1961, which eventually led to the desegregation of interstate transportation in the United States. [4] He was portrayed in the 2007 film "The Great Debaters", which depicted the story of the Wiley College debate team's victory over Harvard University in 1935, when Farmer was a 14-year-old student at Wiley. [1][3][5]

After retiring from CORE in 1971, Farmer continued to be active in civil rights and social justice causes, serving on various boards and committees. He published his autobiography "Lay Bare the Heart" in 1985 and taught at Mary Washington College (now the University of Mary Washington) from 1984 until his retirement in 1998. [4]

Farmer was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1998. He died in 1999 at the age of 79 from complications of diabetes. [4]
