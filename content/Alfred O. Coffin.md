Alfred O. Coffin was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in a field of the biological sciences.[1] He was born in [[Pontotoc]], [[Mississippi]] on May 14, 1861.[1] Coffin earned his bachelor's degree from [[Fisk University]] and his master's and Ph.D. in biology from [[Illinois Wesleyan University]] in 1889.[1] 

From 1887 to 1895, Coffin taught at various institutions, including [[Alcorn Agricultural & Mechanical College]] in Mississippi and [[Wiley University]] in Texas, where he wrote a treatise on native plants.[1] He later worked as a public school principal in San Antonio, Texas and Kansas City, Missouri from 1898 to 1909.[1] 

Coffin's most significant scholarly accomplishments were his books "The Origin of the Mound Builders" (1889) and "Land Without Chimneys, Or The Byways of Mexico" (1896), which was the first significant book on Latin Americans written by a Black American.[1] He also worked as an advance agent for the Blind Boone Concert Company, promoting the blind ragtime musician.[1] 

The date of Coffin's death is unknown.[1]

According to the search results, Alfred O. Coffin was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in biological sciences. He was born in 1861 in Pontotoc, Mississippi and received his bachelor's degree from Fisk University before completing his graduate studies at Illinois Wesleyan University, where he earned his master's and Ph.D. in 1889.[1][2][4]

Coffin's research interests appear to have been in anthropology, and his most notable work was a book titled "The Origin of the Mound Builders" which connected the origins of the mound builders of the Mississippi Valley to an area in Southeastern Mexico.[2][4]

After earning his doctorate, Coffin faced significant barriers in academia due to the racism of the 19th century, and he was unable to secure a faculty position at a predominantly white university. Instead, he taught at two historically Black colleges, Alcorn Agricultural & Mechanical College and Wiley University, where he taught subjects including mathematics and romance languages.[2][4]

Coffin also spent time as a public school principal in San Antonio and Kansas City, and later in life worked as an agent for "Blind" Boone, a blind pianist and ragtime musician.[2]

While Coffin broke barriers as the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in biological sciences, the racist culture of the time severely limited his academic career opportunities.[4]
