Lloyd Lionel Gaines was the plaintiff in Gaines v. Canada (1938), one of the most important early court cases in the 20th-century U.S. civil rights movement.[1][2] After being denied admission to the University of Missouri School of Law because he was African American, and refusing the university's offer to pay for him to attend a neighboring state's law school that had no racial restriction, Gaines filed suit.[2] The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled in his favor, holding that the separate but equal doctrine required that Missouri either admit him or set up a separate law school for Black students.[2] However, Gaines disappeared shortly after the ruling and was never seen again by anyone who knew him.[1][2]

## Personal Life

Lloyd Lionel Gaines was born in 1911 in Water Valley, Mississippi to Henry Richard Gaines, a tenant farmer and former teacher, and his wife Callie. [2][3] Lloyd had ten siblings, but several died during his childhood, as did his father. [3] In 1926, Lloyd's family moved to St. Louis to live with his older brother George. [3] Despite a poor education in Mississippi, Lloyd excelled in high school, serving on the debate team, writing for the school journal, and being elected vice president of his senior class. [3] He graduated from Vashon High School in 1931 and earned a $250 scholarship for college. [3]

## Career

After attending Stowe Teachers College for a year, Lloyd went on to attend Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, graduating in 1935 with a history degree. [3] He then began considering continuing his studies by going to law school. However, in the segregated education system of 1930s Missouri, Lincoln University did not have a law school, so Lloyd would have been forced to leave the state to pursue a law degree. [3] One of Lloyd's former teachers put him in touch with leaders in the NAACP, who saw Lloyd as the perfect plaintiff to challenge Missouri's segregated higher education system. [3] 

In 1935, Lloyd applied to the University of Missouri School of Law, but was denied admission because of his race. [3] With the support of the NAACP, Lloyd sued the university registrar, Silas W. Canada, in what became the landmark Supreme Court case Gaines v. Canada in 1938. The Supreme Court ruled in Lloyd's favor, holding that Missouri's "separate but equal" doctrine required the state to either admit him or establish a separate law school for Black students. [2][3]

## Achievements

The Gaines v. Canada decision was a major victory for the civil rights movement, coming 15 years before the more famous Brown v. Board of Education ruling. [1] Experts believe Gaines' case could have had the same impact as Brown if he had not mysteriously disappeared shortly after the Supreme Court victory. [1] The University of Missouri established the Lincoln University School of Law in St. Louis in response to the ruling, though the NAACP planned to challenge the adequacy of this new school. [2]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

Lloyd Gaines disappeared on March 19, 1939, just three months after his Supreme Court victory, and was never seen again by anyone who knew him. [1][2] There has been much speculation about what happened to him, with some believing he was killed in retaliation for his legal challenge, while others think he may have fled to start a new life in places like New York or Mexico City. [2] His family and civil rights activists like his mentor Lorenzo Greene believed he had been threatened or paid to disappear. [1][2] The case remains one of the oldest unsolved civil rights-era disappearances referred to the FBI. [2]
