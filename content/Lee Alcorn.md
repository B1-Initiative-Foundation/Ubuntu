Lee Alcorn was the president of the Dallas branch of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 2000.[1][3][4][5] During the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Alcorn criticized Al Gore's selection of Senator Joe Lieberman as his vice-presidential running mate, stating that "If we get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering is, I mean, what is this movement for, you know? Does it have anything to do with the failed peace talks?"[1] NAACP President Kweisi Mfume immediately suspended Alcorn and condemned his remarks as "repulsive, anti-Semitic, anti-NAACP and anti-American."[4] Following the controversy, Alcorn resigned from his position with the NAACP after two decades of service.[3][5]

Lee Alcorn was the president of the Dallas chapter of the NAACP in the year 2000. He resigned from his position after making controversial remarks that drew nationwide rebuke.[1][2][3][4]

Alcorn accused the NAACP of "selling out to corporate America" by scaling back protests in order to secure donations from major companies.[2] The national NAACP had suspended Alcorn three times in his five years as Dallas president, starting with a 45-day penalty in 1997 for leading a protest against a Jewish-owned business.[4]

Alcorn's remarks were seen as inflammatory and he faced widespread criticism, leading to his resignation from the NAACP in August 2000.[1][2][3][4] The incident highlighted ongoing tensions within the NAACP over issues of race, corporate influence, and anti-Semitism.[5]
