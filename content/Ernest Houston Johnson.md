Ernest Houston Johnson was the first African American to graduate from Stanford University, earning his bachelor's degree in economics in 1895. [2][3]

## Personal Life
Johnson was born in 1871 near Roseville, California. He was the youngest of four sons of Beverly Johnson, who owned a catering business and was self-educated, with a love for reading Shakespeare. Despite only having a third-grade education, Beverly Johnson ensured his son Ernest was enrolled in a better-equipped white grammar school, rather than the local all-black school, as he believed in providing his children with the best education possible. [2][4]

## Career
After graduating high school in 1889, Johnson applied to both UC Berkeley and Stanford University. While Berkeley accepted him, Stanford initially ignored his application. However, through his father's connections with the Stanfords, who had abolitionist sympathies, Johnson's application was eventually accepted in 1891. [2][4] 

At Stanford, Johnson was known to be popular with his classmates. He played on the university's football team and worked as a printer's apprentice to support himself financially. Majoring in economics, Johnson graduated with Stanford's pioneer class of 1895 and then enrolled in the university's law school, though he did not complete his law degree. [2][3][4]

## Achievements
Johnson's graduation from Stanford in 1895 made him the first African American to do so. This achievement was largely forgotten for over a century until it was rediscovered in the 1990s by a student researcher at Stanford's Black Community Services Center. [2][3][4]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
There do not appear to be any major controversies, myths or misconceptions surrounding Ernest Houston Johnson's life and accomplishments. The sources portray him as a bright, hardworking student who overcame racial barriers to become the first African American to graduate from Stanford.

## Bibliography
There are no published works authored by Ernest Houston Johnson, as he passed away at the young age of 26 due to tuberculosis in 1898, just three years after graduating from Stanford. [2][4]
