Georgiana R. Simpson was the first African American woman to be awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1921.[1][2] She faced significant racism and discrimination during her time as a student, including protests from white Southern female students who objected to her living in their dormitory.[2] Despite these challenges, Simpson persevered and went on to have a distinguished career as an educator, teaching at Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C. and later becoming a professor at Howard University.[2]

Georgiana R. Simpson was a pioneering African American scholar who in 1921 became the first Black woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States. [2][4]

## Personal Life
Georgiana Simpson was born in 1866 in Washington, D.C., where she attended public schools. [4] After graduating, she was trained at a District of Columbia Normal School to become an elementary school teacher, which she began in 1885. [4] Simpson never married. [4]

## Career
In 1907, Simpson enrolled at the University of Chicago to pursue a bachelor's degree in German language and literature. [2][4] However, she faced significant racism and discrimination on campus, including being forced to live off-campus when white students objected to sharing a dormitory with a Black woman. [2][4] To avoid further conflicts, Simpson took many of her courses via correspondence and during the summer. [4] Despite these challenges, she earned her B.A. in 1911. [4] 

Simpson went on to earn a master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1920 and then her Ph.D. in German in 1921 at the age of 55, becoming the first African American woman to receive a doctoral degree in the United States. [2][4] After graduating, she returned to teaching at Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C. [4] In 1931, at the age of 65, Simpson was offered a professorship at Howard University, where she taught until her retirement in 1939. [4]

## Achievements
Simpson's achievement of becoming the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. was groundbreaking. [2][4] She was one of only three Black women to receive doctoral degrees in the United States that year, along with Sadie Tanner Mossell and Eva Beatrice Dykes. [4] Simpson's doctoral dissertation was titled "Herder's Conception of 'Das Volk'". [4] She also wrote articles for publications by W.E.B. Du Bois and was an ally of African American historian Carter G. Woodson. [1]

In 2017, the University of Chicago unveiled a bronze bust of Simpson in the Reynolds Club to honor her pioneering accomplishments and legacy. [3] The Georgiana Rose Organization (GRO), a campus group at the University of Chicago, was also founded to support Black women and feminine-aligned students in academia. [1]
