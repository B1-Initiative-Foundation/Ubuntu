James McCune Smith was the first African American to earn a medical degree, which he received from the University of Glasgow in Scotland in 1837.[2][3][5] After returning to the United States, he became the first African American to run a pharmacy in the country.[5] 

Smith was a prominent abolitionist, public intellectual, and civil rights activist. He contributed articles to medical journals, participated in learned societies, and wrote numerous essays and articles drawing from his medical and statistical training.[2][5] He used his expertise to refute common misconceptions about race, intelligence, medicine, and society.[5] Smith was a member of the American Anti-Slavery Society and helped start the National Council of Colored People in 1853, the first permanent national organization for blacks.[2][5] Abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass considered Smith "the single most important influence on his life."[5]

In 1863, Smith was appointed as professor of anthropology at Wilberforce College, the first African American-owned and operated college in the United States, but was too ill to take the position.[5] He died in 1865 at the age of 52 from congestive heart failure, just 19 days before the ratification of the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery.[5] Smith was survived by his wife and five children, who later passed into white society to escape racial discrimination.[5]

In 2018, the New York Academy of Medicine posthumously inducted Smith as a fellow, 171 years after his nomination and 153 years after his death.[5] The University of Glasgow has also named its new learning hub building the James McCune Smith Learning Hub, which opened in 2021.[3][4]

Here is a concise biography of James McCune Smith:

## Personal Life
James McCune Smith was born in 1813 in New York City to a mother who had purchased her own freedom and a father who may have been a freed slave or a white merchant.[1][2] He attended the African Free School in New York, where he excelled as a student and was chosen at age 11 to deliver a speech to the Marquis de Lafayette.[1] Unable to attend college in the United States due to racial discrimination, Smith went on to earn bachelor's, master's, and medical degrees from the University of Glasgow in Scotland, becoming the first African American to earn a medical degree.[2][3][4]

## Career
After returning to New York, Smith opened a medical practice and pharmacy, becoming the first African American to run a pharmacy in the United States.[2][3] He practiced medicine at the Colored Orphan Asylum in Manhattan for nearly 20 years.[2] Smith was a prolific writer, contributing articles to medical journals and publishing essays and lectures refuting racist ideas about black inferiority.[2][4][5] He was a prominent abolitionist, working with Frederick Douglass to establish the National Council of the Colored People, the first permanent national organization for African Americans.[2][3]

## Achievements
Smith was elected as a member of the New York Statistics Society and the American Geographic Society, though he was never admitted to the American Medical Association due to racial discrimination.[2][3] He was appointed as a professor of anthropology at Wilberforce College in 1863, though he was too ill to take the position.[3] In 2018, the New York Academy of Medicine posthumously inducted Smith as a fellow, and in 2021 the University of Glasgow named a new building after him.[3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
There is no evidence of Smith being involved in any controversies, racist, homophobic, or antisemitic activities. To the contrary, he was a vocal opponent of racism and slavery.[2][4][5] His children and grandchildren did pass as white to escape racial discrimination, but this was a common survival strategy for mixed-race families at the time.[3]

## Bibliography
Smith did not publish any books, but his collected essays, speeches, and letters have been published as *The Works of James McCune Smith: Black Intellectual and Abolitionist* (2006), edited by John Stauffer.[3]
