Martin Henry Freeman was the first African-American to become a college president in the United States. [1][2] He served as President of the all-black Allegheny Institute (later Avery College) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1851 to 1862. [1] 

In 1863, Freeman relocated to Liberia, where he taught mathematics, algebra, geometry, chemistry, natural philosophy, Latin and Greek at Liberia College. He later served as the acting president of Liberia College from 1868 until his death in 1889. [1][3]

Despite facing racial prejudice during his time at Middlebury College, Freeman delivered the Salutatory address at his commencement in 1849. [1] He was later cynical about the future of black Americans in the United States and embraced the idea of emigration to Africa. [3]

Martin Henry Freeman was the first African-American college president in the United States. He was born in 1826 in Rutland, Vermont and graduated from Middlebury College in 1849 at the top of his class, despite facing racial prejudice during his time there.[3][4] 

After graduating, Freeman taught at the Allegheny Institute and Mission Church, a historically black college in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was promoted to president of the college in 1856, making him the first African-American college president in the country.[2][3]

In 1864, Freeman and his family moved to Liberia, where he taught at Liberia College and later served as its president from 1868 until his death in 1889.[3][4] During his time in Liberia, Freeman faced discrimination due to his dark skin, despite his support for the colonization of Liberia by African-Americans.[2]

Freeman made significant contributions as an educator and academic leader during a time of widespread racism and limited opportunities for African-Americans. His achievements as the first Black college president in the United States are an important part of the history of higher education and the African-American experience.[1][2][3][4]
