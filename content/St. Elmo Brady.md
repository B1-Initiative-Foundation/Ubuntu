St. Elmo Brady was the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry in the United States, which he earned from the University of Illinois in 1916.[1][2][3][4] He conducted research in organic chemistry and played a key role in developing chemistry education at several historically black colleges and universities.[1][3][4] Brady was the first African American admitted to the University of Illinois' chemical honor society, Phi Lambda Upsilon, in 1914, and one of the first to be inducted into Sigma Xi, the science honorary society, in 1915.[2][4] After completing his graduate studies, Brady taught at Tuskegee University, Howard University, and Fisk University, where he chaired the chemistry department for 25 years until his retirement in 1952.[2][3][4] He was known for his dedication to building strong undergraduate chemistry programs and founding the first graduate chemistry program at a historically black college.[3][4]
