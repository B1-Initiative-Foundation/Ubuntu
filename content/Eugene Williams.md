Eugene Williams was one of the nine young black men falsely accused of rape in the infamous Scottsboro case in 1931. At just 13 years old, Williams was traveling from Chattanooga to Memphis looking for work with his friends Haywood Patterson, Roy Wright, and Andy Wright when they were arrested and charged with the rape of two white women on a train in Alabama.[4] Despite a lack of evidence, Williams and the other "Scottsboro Boys" were put on trial and faced the death penalty. Their case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the defendants had been denied proper legal counsel.[1][2] Though Williams' charges were eventually dropped, he and the other Scottsboro Boys suffered greatly from this grave miscarriage of justice.[1][2]

Eugene Williams was one of the nine Scottsboro Boys, a group of young African American men who were falsely accused of raping two white women in 1931 in Alabama.[1][2][3]

## Personal Life
Eugene Williams was only 13 years old when he was arrested as part of the Scottsboro Boys case.[1] He was traveling from Chattanooga to Memphis with three of his friends, Haywood Patterson and brothers Andy and Roy Wright, in search of work.[1] 

## Career
There is no information available about Eugene Williams' career, as the focus of the Scottsboro Boys case was on the false accusations and trials, rather than the individual lives of the young men.[1][2][3]

## Achievements
Eugene Williams was one of the Scottsboro Boys who were eventually exonerated, though the process took many years. In 1937, the state of Alabama dropped all charges against him, Willie Roberson, Olen Montgomery, and Roy Wright, after they had already spent six years in prison.[2] In 2013, over 80 years after the initial convictions, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles granted posthumous pardons to three of the Scottsboro Boys, though it is unclear if Eugene Williams was included.[2]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
The Scottsboro Boys case was rife with racism and injustice. Eugene Williams, along with the other young black men, were falsely accused of rape by two white women, Victoria Price and Ruby Bates, despite a lack of evidence.[1][2][3] The trials were conducted in a highly prejudiced atmosphere, with an all-white jury convicting the Scottsboro Boys.[2][3] It was not until years later that Ruby Bates recanted her testimony, admitting the accusations were false.[2]

## Bibliography
There does not appear to be any books authored by Eugene Williams specifically. The Scottsboro Boys case has been the subject of numerous books and historical accounts, but these focus on the broader case rather than the individual lives of the young men.[1][2][3]
