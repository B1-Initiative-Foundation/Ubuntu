Fred Gray was a pioneering civil rights attorney who played a crucial role in the civil rights movement in the United States. Here are the key details about his life and career:

## Personal Life
Fred Gray was born on December 14, 1930 in Montgomery, Alabama, the youngest of five children. He grew up in the segregated South, with his mother dreaming that he would become a preacher. He attended the Nashville Christian Institute from 7th grade until graduating at age 17, before enrolling at Alabama State College with the intention of becoming a teacher[1][2].

## Career
While in college, Gray witnessed the struggles faced by the Black community in Montgomery, particularly with the segregation on public transportation. This inspired him to change his career path and become a lawyer instead, with the goal of "destroy[ing] everything segregated [he] could find"[2]. 

After graduating from law school at Case Western Reserve University, Gray returned to Montgomery and opened his own law practice. In 1955, he represented 15-year-old Claudette Colvin, who was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger, nine months before Rosa Parks' famous act of civil disobedience[3]. Gray went on to represent Parks as well, and was the chief counsel for the Montgomery bus boycott that followed[1][3].

## Achievements
Gray was a key figure in many of the landmark civil rights cases of the era. He represented Martin Luther King Jr. and other activists, and was described by King as the "chief counsel" of the civil rights movement[1][3]. Gray also played a central role in desegregating schools and securing voting rights[3].

In 2022, at the age of 91, Gray was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of his lifelong commitment to civil rights[3].
