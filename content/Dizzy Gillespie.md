Dizzy Gillespie was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, composer, and singer who was one of the seminal figures of the bebop movement. [3][4]

## Personal Life
Gillespie was born on October 21, 1917 in Cheraw, South Carolina. His father was a bricklayer and amateur bandleader who introduced him to several instruments. After his father's death in 1927, Gillespie taught himself the trumpet and trombone. He attended the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina for two years, where he played in the band and took music classes. [3]

In the mid-1960s, Gillespie settled down in Englewood, New Jersey, with his wife. The local Englewood public high school, Dwight Morrow High School, named its auditorium after him: the 'Dizzy Gillespie Auditorium'. 

## Career
Gillespie's early style showed the strong influences of his idol, trumpeter Roy Eldridge. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, he played in a number of prominent swing bands, including those led by Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald, Earl Hines, Duke Ellington, and Billy Eckstine. [3][4]

Gillespie was among the regulars at Minton's Playhouse in New York City who pioneered the bebop sound and style, along with Charlie Parker, Charlie Christian, Thelonious Monk, and Max Roach. In 1944, the first bebop recording session included Gillespie's "Woody 'n' You" and featured him and Coleman Hawkins. Gillespie and Parker were regarded as cofounders of the bebop movement. [3]

Gillespie formed his own orchestra in the late 1940s, which was considered one of the finest large jazz ensembles. It featured complex arrangements and instrumental virtuosity, with a repertoire divided between the bop approach and Afro-Cuban jazz. [3]

From the 1950s onward, Gillespie played mostly in small groups, but he continued to perform at the highest level. During the 1970s, he made several big band, small-group, and duet recordings that rank among his best work. In his later years, he led the United Nations Orchestra, which featured his protégés Paquito D'Rivera and Arturo Sandoval. [3][4]

## Achievements
Gillespie is considered by many to be the greatest jazz trumpeter of all time, alongside Louis Armstrong. He took the saxophone-influenced lines of Roy Eldridge and executed them faster, with greater ease and harmonic daring. Gillespie helped popularize the interval of the augmented eleventh (flat fifth) as a characteristic sound in modern jazz. [3]

Gillespie's songbook is a list of bebop's greatest hits, including "Salt Peanuts," "Woody 'n' You," "Con Alma," "Groovin' High," "Blue 'n' Boogie," and "A Night in Tunisia."[3][4]

Gillespie received numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award in 1991, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1990, and a Grammy Award in 1975. He was also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2014. [3][4]
