E. Franklin Frazier was a pioneering African-American sociologist who made significant contributions to the study of the African-American family and the black middle class. [1][4] He was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1894 and received his education from [[Howard University]], [[Clark University]], and the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned his Ph.D. in 1931. [1][4]

Frazier was a harsh critic of racism and Jim Crow, and his research focused on how social and historical factors such as slavery, white terror, and urban migration affected the African-American family. [1][4] His first major work, "The Negro Family in the United States" (1939), examined these issues and launched an important intellectual debate with Melville J. Herskovits over the influence of African culture on black Americans. [1][4]

Frazier's most celebrated and criticized work was "Black Bourgeoisie" (1957), in which he criticized the cultural elitism and materialism of the black middle class. [4] He was also known for his activism, having been arrested for protesting the movie "Birth of a Nation" and opposing U.S. participation in World War I due to the racial discrimination in the country. [1]

Frazier held academic positions at various institutions, including [[Tuskegee Institute]], [[St. Paul's Normal and Industrial School]], [[Atlanta University]], [[Fisk University]], and [[Howard University]], where he served as the chair of the sociology department until his death in 1962. [1][4] He is considered one of the most prominent African-American sociologists of the 20th century. [4]

E. Franklin Frazier was an American sociologist and author who made significant contributions to the study of African-American culture and race relations in the 20th century. Here is a summary of his life and work:

## Personal Life
Frazier was born in 1894 in Baltimore, Maryland to James H. Frazier, a bank messenger, and Mary (Clark) Frazier, a homemaker. He attended segregated public schools in Baltimore and was awarded a scholarship to attend Howard University, a prominent historically black college, where he graduated with honors in 1916.[1][2]

## Career
After graduating from Howard, Frazier went on to earn a master's degree in sociology from Clark University in 1920.[2] He then spent a year as a Russell Sage Foundation fellow at the New York School of Social Work (later part of Columbia University).[1] Frazier taught sociology at several institutions, including Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he established the Atlanta University School of Social Work.[1][2] 

In 1927, Frazier published an article titled "The Pathology of Race Prejudice" in Forum magazine, which led to his dismissal from Morehouse.[2][3] He then entered the doctoral program at the University of Chicago, completing his Ph.D. in 1931 with a dissertation on "The Negro Family in Chicago."[2] Frazier taught at Fisk University until 1943, when he became chair of the sociology department at Howard University, where he remained until his death in 1962.[1][2]

## Achievements
Frazier's most well-known work was his 1939 book "The Negro Family in the United States," which was among the first sociological studies on African Americans written by a Black scholar.[1][2] He also published other influential books such as "Black Bourgeoisie" (1957), a critique of the Black middle class.[2][3] 

In 1948, Frazier was elected as the first Black president of the American Sociological Association.[4] He also served as director of the Division of Applied Social Sciences for UNESCO from 1951-1953, where he worked on the Tension and Social Change Project.[5]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Frazier was a controversial figure who faced criticism from both white and Black audiences for his outspoken views on race relations and the Black community. His 1927 article "The Pathology of Race Prejudice" characterized racism as a form of mental illness, which led to his dismissal from Morehouse College.[2][3] His book "Black Bourgeoisie" was also widely criticized for its harsh critique of the Black middle class.[2][3]
