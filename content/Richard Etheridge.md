Richard Etheridge (1842-1900) was a remarkable figure in American history, particularly for his contributions to the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) as the first African American Keeper in the USLSS. Born into slavery on Roanoke Island, North Carolina, Etheridge's life was marked by resilience and determination. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, where he was appointed as one of the sergeants in Company F of the Second North Carolina Colored Volunteers. After the war, he returned to Roanoke Island and became a fisherman, honing his skills in navigating the unpredictable waters of the Outer Banks.

In 1875, Etheridge joined the USLSS as a surfman, serving at the Bodie Island station. He quickly distinguished himself as an outstanding surfman, and in 1880, he was promoted to Keeper at Station 17. Despite facing challenges, such as the departure of his white surfmen, Etheridge filled their positions with other African American surfmen, creating the first all-black crew in Life-Saving Station history. He led his crew with military discipline and precision, training them to be among the most skilled and capable on the Carolina Coast.

Etheridge's leadership was tested in May 1880 when arsonists set fire to their station. Undeterred, he led his crew through the crisis, and they gained a reputation as one of the most effective life-saving crews in the region. Their most notable rescue occurred on October 11, 1896, when they saved all of the crew members and passengers aboard the E.S. Newman, which was grounded on a sandbar in a hurricane.

Etheridge continued to serve as Keeper until his death on May 8, 1900, due to an unknown illness. His legacy was honored in 1996 when the Coast Guard posthumously awarded him and his crew the Gold Lifesaving Medal for their exceptional service. Today, he is remembered for his bravery, leadership, and commitment to saving lives, as well as his service in the Union Army and his role in the USLSS[1][2][3][4][5].
