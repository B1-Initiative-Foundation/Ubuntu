James Henry Conyers was the first African-American person admitted to the United States Naval Academy in 1872 at the age of 16.[1] He was nominated for the position by South Carolina Congressman [[Elliott]].[2] 

Conyers faced severe hazing and discrimination from his white classmates at the Naval Academy, including verbal abuse, physical beatings, and even attempts to drown him.[1][4] After enduring this treatment for a year, Conyers resigned from the Academy in October 1873.[1]

After leaving the Naval Academy, Conyers returned to Charleston and worked as a ship's caulker for the rest of his life.[1][2] He married [[Fannie Elizabeth Steele]] in 1881 and they had nine children, seven of whom lived to maturity.[1][2] Conyers died in Charleston in 1935 and was buried in the Humane and Friendly Society Cemetery.[1][4]

While Conyers did not graduate from the Naval Academy, his pioneering efforts paved the way for future African-American midshipmen and his story of courage and perseverance in the face of adversity is an important part of the Academy's history.[4]

James Henry Conyers was the first African-American person admitted to the United States Naval Academy in 1872[2][3]. Some key details about his experience:

## Personal Life
Conyers was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1855[2]. He received his early education at the Avery Normal Institute in Charleston and worked as a messenger before being nominated to the Naval Academy[2].

## Career
In 1872, at the age of 16, Conyers was nominated to the Naval Academy by South Carolina Congressman Robert B. Elliott, another African-American[1][2][3]. Conyers successfully completed the required examinations and was sworn in as a "cadet-midshipman" on September 24, 1872[2]. 

## Controversies and Challenges
From the beginning, Conyers faced intense discrimination and hazing from his white classmates at the Academy. He was cursed at, spat upon, and physically abused[2][4]. The abuse was so severe that Conyers' academic performance suffered, and he was found "deficient" in several subjects in 1873[2][4]. 

Despite attempts by the Academy to address the hazing, the abuse continued in more subtle forms[2][4]. After surviving another hazing incident, Conyers finally resigned from the Academy in October 1873[2].

## Later Life
After leaving the Naval Academy, Conyers returned to Charleston and worked as a ship's caulker for the rest of his life[2]. He married Fannie Elizabeth Steele in 1881 and they had nine children, seven of whom lived to adulthood[2].

Conyers died in Charleston in 1935 and was buried in the Humane and Friendly Society Cemetery[2]. In 2022, 150 years after his groundbreaking enrollment, the Naval Academy Alumni Association unveiled a memorial marker near his gravesite to honor his legacy[3].
