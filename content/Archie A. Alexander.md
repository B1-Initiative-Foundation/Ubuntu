Archie A. Alexander was an accomplished African-American engineer and architect who overcame significant racial barriers to achieve great success in his career.

## Personal Life
Archie Alexander was born on May 14, 1888 in Ottumwa, Iowa to Price and Mary Alexander. He was the oldest of nine children in a small African-American community. When the family moved to a farm outside Des Moines, Alexander attended Oak Park High School, graduating in 1905. He went on to attend Highland Park College and Cummins Art College before enrolling at the State University of Iowa (now the University of Iowa) to study engineering. [1][2]

Alexander faced many challenges as a black student at the university, being the only African-American in the engineering program. However, he persisted and became the first black person to graduate from the University of Iowa's engineering school in 1912. [2][5] During college, Alexander also played football for the university team, earning the nickname "Alexander the Great". [2][3]

In 1913, Alexander married Audra A. Linzy in Denver, Colorado. They had one child, Archibald Alphonso Jr., who died at a young age. Alexander died of a heart attack in 1958 in Des Moines, Iowa. [3]

## Career
After graduating, Alexander worked as a foreman for Marsh Engineering Company, a Des Moines firm that specialized in bridge design and construction. In 1914, he started his own engineering company, A.A. Alexander, Inc. [1][2] 

In 1929, Alexander took on a new partner, Maurice A. Repass, and the firm was renamed Alexander & Repass. The company went on to become highly successful, completing major infrastructure projects across the United States, including the Whitehurst Freeway, the Tidal Basin Bridge, and an extension to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. [1][4]

Alexander's firm also constructed Moton Airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama, which was used extensively for training the famous Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. The company was praised as "the nation's most famous interracial business" in 1949. [1]

## Achievements
Alexander received numerous accolades over the course of his career. In 1926, he was honored with the Harmon Award for Distinguished Achievement Among Negroes and the Laurel Wreath Award from Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. [1] 

In 1925, the University of Iowa awarded Alexander an honorary master's degree in engineering, and in 1946 he received an honorary doctorate in engineering from Howard University. [2][5]

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Alexander as the Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, making him the first Republican to hold that position since the establishment of the civil government. However, his tenure was controversial and he resigned in 1955. [3]
