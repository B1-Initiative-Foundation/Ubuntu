Here is a concise biography of Frederick Douglass Patterson:

## Personal Life
Frederick Douglass Patterson was born on October 10, 1901 in Washington, D.C. to Mamie Lucille and William Ross Patterson. He was named after the famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Patterson was orphaned at the age of 2 when both his parents died of tuberculosis. He was then raised by his sister Bessie, who sacrificed a significant portion of her $20 monthly salary to ensure he received a good education, enrolling him in the private elementary school of Samuel Huston College (now Huston-Tillotson College) in Texas.[1][2]

## Career
After excelling in his studies, Patterson went on to earn three advanced degrees by the age of 31 - a Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine and Master of Science from Iowa State University, and a Doctorate of Philosophy from Cornell University.[3] He then returned to Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) where he had previously taught, becoming the head of the Department of Agriculture and the first person on the faculty to earn a doctorate.[1][2]

In 1935, at the age of 33, Patterson became the third president of Tuskegee Institute, helping to transform it into a prestigious university with cutting-edge graduate programs.[2] In 1944, he conceived and founded the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), the first cooperative fundraising venture in American higher education, which continues to provide critical support to historically Black colleges and universities today.[1][2]

## Achievements
During his tenure, Patterson advanced the Phelps-Stokes Fund, a philanthropic foundation focused on African American education, as its director and later president from 1953 to 1969.[1] He also served on the boards of numerous historically Black colleges and universities, including Hampton Institute (now University), Tuskegee Institute (now University), Interdenominational Theological Center, and Bennett College, where he served as chairman of the Board of Trustees.[1][3]

In recognition of his contributions, Patterson received 20 honorary degrees from various colleges and universities, and in 1987 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Ronald Reagan.[3]
