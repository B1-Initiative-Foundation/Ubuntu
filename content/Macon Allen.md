Macon Bolling Allen was the first African American licensed to practice law in the United States.[1][4][5] He was born around 1816 in [[Indiana]] and later moved to [[Maine]].[4][5] In Maine, Allen served as a law apprentice to a prominent attorney with anti-slavery views who advocated for Allen's admission to the Maine bar.[4][5] Despite being denied admission initially on the grounds that he was not a legal "citizen" because he was Black, Allen passed the examination for nonresidents and became the first licensed African-American lawyer in the United States in 1844.[1][4][5] 

Allen experienced difficulty finding legal work in Maine because white people were unwilling to hire a Black attorney, and few Black people lived there.[4][5] He moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1845 and passed the bar exam there, becoming the first practicing lawyer in Massachusetts.[4][5] Allen also became the first African-American judicial official when he was appointed as a justice of the peace in Massachusetts in 1848, despite not being a U.S. citizen under the Constitution at the time.[4][5]

After the American Civil War, Allen moved to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to practice law and was elected to be a judge in the probate court of Charleston in 1874.[4][5] Following the Reconstruction Era, he moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where he worked as an attorney for the Land and Improvement Association until his death in 1894 at the age of 78.[4][5]

However, Allen faced difficulty finding legal work in Maine due to racial prejudice, so he moved to Boston in 1845 and passed the bar exam there, becoming the first African American to practice law in Massachusetts. [2][4][5]

To supplement his legal career, Allen was appointed as a Justice of the Peace in Middlesex County, Massachusetts in 1848, making him the first African American judicial official in the U.S. [2][4][5]

After the Civil War, Allen moved to Charleston, South Carolina where he helped form the first all-African American law firm with William Whipper and Robert Elliott. He was later elected as a judge in the probate court of Charleston in 1874. [1][2][5]

In the late 1870s, Allen moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as an attorney for the Land and Improvement Association until his death in 1894 at the age of 78. [1][2][5]
