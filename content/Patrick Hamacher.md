In 1997, Hamacher applied for admission to the University of Michigan's LSA program. His application was denied, even though an underrepresented minority applicant with his qualifications would have been admitted. [1][4]

After being denied admission, Hamacher, along with Jennifer Gratz, filed a class-action lawsuit against the University of Michigan in October 1997. The lawsuit alleged that the university's use of racial preferences in its undergraduate admissions program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981. [1][4]

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in 2003 that the university's use of a points-based system that automatically awarded points to applicants based on their race was unconstitutional. However, the Court upheld the university's ability to consider race as one factor among many in admissions decisions to achieve a diverse student body. [3][4]
