Davis received his B.A. degree from [[Grinnell College]] and his J.D. degree from [[Northwestern University]] in 1964.[1]

After graduating from law school, Davis moved to Mali, West Africa where he worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development coordinating smallpox eradication efforts and vocational training for three years.[1] Upon returning to Chicago in 1967, Davis accepted a legal position at the Metropolitan Housing and Planning Council. In 1969, he co-founded the [[Chicago Council of Lawyers]], a group focused on electing judges based on a merit system.[1] 

In 1971, Davis co-founded the [[Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland]] law firm in Chicago, which focused on civil rights litigation. The firm hired [[Carol Moseley Braun]], who later became the first African American female U.S. Senator, and [[Barack Obama]] as a recent graduate of Harvard Law School.[1]

W. Allison Davis was an accomplished African-American anthropologist, educator, and scholar who made significant contributions to the understanding of race, class, and education in the United States. Here is a summary of his life and work:

## Personal Life
W. Allison Davis was born in 1902 in Washington, D.C. to a family with a history of activism and achievement. He graduated valedictorian from the segregated Dunbar High School in 1920 and continued his impressive academic record, graduating summa cum laude and valedictorian from Williams College in 1924.[1] He went on to earn master's degrees from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Chicago.[1]

## Career
Despite his stellar academic credentials, Davis faced racial discrimination when he applied for a teaching position at his alma mater, Williams College, in 1925. He was denied the opportunity, which would have made him the first African-American professor at the college.[1] This experience had a profound effect on Davis, who bore a lingering resentment toward Williams for much of his life.[1]

Davis went on to teach at Hampton Institute in Virginia from 1925-1931, where he worked to inspire rural black students to think and write critically.[1] He later joined the faculty of the anthropology department at Dillard University in New Orleans, where he conducted groundbreaking fieldwork on black adolescents in collaboration with Yale psychologist John Dollard.[1] 

In 1941, Davis joined the faculty at the University of Chicago, becoming the second African-American to hold a tenure-track position at a major predominantly white university.[2][3] At Chicago, Davis became known for his pioneering research on the relationship between academic performance and socioeconomic status, as well as his persistent criticism of the cultural bias in intelligence testing.[1][2]

## Achievements
Davis made significant contributions to the intellectual foundations of the federal Head Start program and influenced the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision through his research on the impact of racial segregation and poverty on educational outcomes.[4] He was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to serve on the Civil Rights Commission in 1967 and became the first John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago in 1970.[3] In 1972, Davis became the first scholar of education to be inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
Despite his many accomplishments, Davis faced persistent racism and marginalization throughout his career. As the first African-American professor at a major white university, he was openly debated by faculty members and barred from the faculty club.[5] His contributions were often subsumed under those of his white collaborators, and he was even omitted from lists of prominent black scholars studying poverty.[5]
