Prince Henry the Navigator was a Portuguese prince who played a significant role in the Age of Exploration and the expansion of the Portuguese Empire in the 15th century. Here is a summary of the key facts about him:

## Personal Life
Prince Henry was born in 1394 in Porto, Portugal. He was the third son of King John I of Portugal and Philippa of Lancaster. Henry and his brothers were educated under the supervision of their parents and developed interests in chivalry, astrology, and military campaigns. [1][2]

## Career
In 1415, Henry helped his father capture the Moroccan city of Ceuta, which became an important Portuguese outpost. He was appointed as the king's lieutenant in Ceuta, though he did not have permanent residence there. [2][3]

As the Grand Master of the Order of Christ, Henry sponsored numerous voyages of discovery along the western coast of Africa. He sought to expand Portuguese trade, especially in gold and enslaved persons, and establish colonies on islands like Madeira. [2][3]

## Achievements
Henry's patronage led to advancements in navigation, including the development of the caravel ship and improved navigational instruments. His expeditions explored over 1,500 miles of the West African coastline, discovering or rediscovering islands like the Azores and Cape Verde. [4][5]

However, Henry's voyages also laid the groundwork for the Atlantic slave trade, which became a major part of the Portuguese colonial economy. [1]

## Controversies, Myths, and Misconceptions
The epithet "the Navigator" is considered a misnomer, as Henry himself never actually went on any exploratory voyages. The legend of him establishing a "school of navigation" at Sagres has also been debunked by historians. [1][2][3]

## Bibliography
There are no books authored by Prince Henry the Navigator, as he was a patron of exploration rather than an explorer himself.
