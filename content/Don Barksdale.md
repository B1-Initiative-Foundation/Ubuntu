Don Barksdale was an American professional basketball player who was a pioneer as an African-American in the sport. [1][2] He was the first African-American player named to the consensus All-America team in 1947 while at UCLA. [2][3] Barksdale was also the first Black player to play for the U.S. Olympic basketball team, winning a gold medal at the 1948 London Games. [2][3] 

In the NBA, Barksdale was the league's first Black All-Star, being voted to the East team by other players in 1953. [1][2] However, his NBA career was relatively short, just four seasons, as Black players were prevented from playing in the league until 1950. [2] During his time in the NBA, Barksdale averaged 11 points and 8 rebounds per game, with his best season coming in 1952-53 when he averaged 13.8 points. [1]

Off the court, Barksdale was a successful businessman, entrepreneur, music industry insider, real estate investor and philanthropist. [2] He was described as being "way ahead of his time" and embodying the idea of being "More Than An Athlete" long before it became a common slogan. [2]

Don Barksdale was a pioneering African-American basketball player who attended UCLA in the late 1940s. Some key facts about his time at UCLA:

- Barksdale was the first African-American to be named a consensus All-American in 1947 after helping lead the UCLA Bruins to the Pacific Coast Conference championship. [1][2]

- Prior to UCLA, Barksdale was cut from his high school basketball team for three straight years due to racial quotas limiting the number of black players. However, he honed his skills playing at local parks and recreation centers. [1]

- At UCLA, Barksdale topped all previous single-season scoring records for the basketball team. He also won the 1944 National AAU triple jump championship during his time at UCLA. [4]

- In 1948, Barksdale became the first African-American to play on the U.S. Olympic basketball team, winning a gold medal. The team was coached by Kentucky's Adolph Rupp, who had not yet recruited his first black player for the Wildcats. [1]

- After his UCLA career, Barksdale played professionally in the NBA, becoming the first African-American NBA All-Star in 1953. He played for the Baltimore Bullets and Boston Celtics. [2][4]

In summary, Don Barksdale was a trailblazing African-American basketball player who excelled at UCLA, the Olympics, and in the early NBA, breaking racial barriers at every step. [1][2][4]
