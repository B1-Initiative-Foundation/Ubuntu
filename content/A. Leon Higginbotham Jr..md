After graduating from Yale, Higginbotham was unable to find work at major law firms due to racial discrimination, so he co-founded the first African American law firm in Philadelphia in 1954.[3][4] He went on to serve in various public roles, including as a special deputy state attorney general, a commissioner on the Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission, and president of the Philadelphia NAACP chapter.[1][2][4]

In 1962, President Kennedy appointed Higginbotham to the Federal Trade Commission, making him the first African American to serve on a federal regulatory commission.[1][2][3] He was later nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Johnson in 1964, becoming one of the youngest federal judges at the time.[1][2][4] 

Higginbotham was elevated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 1977 by President Carter, and served as Chief Judge from 1989 to 1991.[2][4] After retiring from the bench in 1993, he taught at Harvard University and advised Nelson Mandela on South Africa's new constitution.[1][4]
