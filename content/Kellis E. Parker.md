## Personal Life
Kellis E. Parker was born on January 19, 1942 in Kinston, North Carolina. His parents operated the first Black-owned dry cleaning store in the segregated town, and faced prejudice and discrimination in their business. [1] Parker grew up in this environment of racial segregation, but challenged it from a young age - he appealed to the town's Chamber of Commerce to allow the Black high school marching band to march at the front of parades, and they agreed, to his surprise. [1] Parker was an accomplished trombonist in high school, and his brothers Maceo and Melvin also became professional musicians. [1][2]

## Career

[1][3] He then served as a law clerk for Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals. [1] In 1972, Parker became the first full-time African-American law professor at Columbia University, a position he held until his death in 2000. [1][2][4] 

## Achievements

[1][2] He incorporated civil rights remedies into his teaching, and published works like the 1975 casebook "Modern Judicial Remedies" that addressed racial issues through the law. [4] Parker also taught a course on "Jazz Roots Revisited: The Law the Slaves Made", drawing parallels between the improvisational nature of jazz and the customary laws developed by Black communities.
