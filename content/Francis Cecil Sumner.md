Here is a concise biography of Francis Cecil Sumner based on the search results:

## Personal Life
Francis Cecil Sumner was born on December 7, 1895 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. He was the son of David and Lillian Sumner and had one brother named Eugene. Sumner's parents were deeply concerned about the poor quality of education available to Black children at the time, so they provided him with an intensive home-based education, including reading and writing assignments developed by his father. [1][3]

Sumner enrolled at Lincoln University in 1911 at the age of 15, despite not having a high school diploma. He graduated in 1915 as valedictorian with a degree in philosophy. [1][3] Sumner later married Frances H. Hughston in 1922, but the marriage ended in divorce. He then married Nettie M. Broker in 1946, though he had no children from either marriage. [1][3]

## Career
After graduating from Lincoln, Sumner went on to earn a second bachelor's degree in English from Clark University in 1916. He developed a close mentorship with Clark's president, psychologist G. Stanley Hall, which led Sumner to seriously consider psychology as a graduate major. [1][3] 

Sumner served in the U.S. military during World War I from 1918 to 1919. Upon his return, he completed his doctorate in psychology at Clark University in 1920, becoming the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in psychology. [1][2][3][4][5]

Sumner's first teaching position was at Wilberforce University in 1920, followed by a stint at Southern University in 1921. In 1921, he joined the faculty at West Virginia Collegiate Institute (now West Virginia State University), where he published controversial articles on improving African American education. [1][3]

From 1928 until his death in 1954, Sumner served as the chair of the psychology department at Howard University, a historically Black institution. There, he taught many influential Black psychologists, including Kenneth Bancroft Clark. [2][3][4]

## Achievements
Sumner is considered the "Father of Black Psychology" for being the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in psychology. [2][4][5] He worked to dismantle racism and bias in psychological research, particularly studies that claimed intellectual inferiority in African Americans. [2]

In 1939, Sumner's application for membership in the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology was initially rejected, but other members threatened to resign if he was not accepted. This incident highlighted the discrimination he faced as a Black scholar. [2]

Sumner's legacy continues to influence modern education, as his lifelong efforts to increase funding and teaching of Black history and experiences have had a lasting impact. [2]
