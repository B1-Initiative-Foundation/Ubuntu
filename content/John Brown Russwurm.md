John Brown Russwurm was a Jamaican-born American abolitionist, newspaper publisher, and colonist of Liberia.[1][2][3][4] He was born in [[Port Antonio]], [[Jamaica]] in 1799 to an English merchant father, [[John R. Russwurm]], and an unknown Black slave mother.[2][3][4] At age 8, he was sent to [[Quebec]] for formal schooling, and in 1812 his father brought him to [[Portland]], [[Maine]], where he married [[Susan Blanchard]] and had Russwurm acknowledge his paternity.[3][4]

Russwurm attended [[Hebron Academy]] and later graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1826, becoming one of the first Black university graduates in the United States.[2][3][4] In 1827, he co-founded the first Black-owned and operated newspaper in the U.S., [[Freedom's Journal]], with [[Samuel Cornish]].[2][3] However, in 1829 he resigned from the paper and took a post in [[Liberia]], shocking the Black community.[2][3]

In Liberia, Russwurm quickly gained prominence, editing the [[Liberia Herald]] from 1830 to 1835 and serving as superintendent of education for [[Monrovia]].[2][3] In 1836, he became the first Black governor of the [[Maryland in Liberia]] colony, a position he held until his death in 1851.[2][3] Russwurm was an able administrator who established positive relations with neighboring African nations and encouraged the immigration of African Americans to Liberia.[2][3]

John Brown Russwurm was a pioneering African American abolitionist, newspaper publisher, and government official in Liberia. Some key facts about his life and accomplishments:

- He was born in 1799 in Jamaica to an English father and enslaved mother. As a child, he was sent to Quebec for schooling and later moved to Maine with his father.[2][3]

- Russwurm became the first African American to graduate from Bowdoin College in 1826.[2][4] He then taught at a school for Black children in Boston.[4]

- In 1827, Russwurm co-founded Freedom's Journal, the first newspaper in the United States owned, operated, and edited by African Americans. As editor, he advocated against slavery and for equal rights.[1][2][3][5]

- In 1829, Russwurm resigned from Freedom's Journal and emigrated to Liberia, becoming an early supporter of the Pan-African movement. He served as colonial secretary and editor of the Liberia Herald.[1][2][3]

- In 1836, Russwurm was appointed as the first Black governor of the Maryland section of Liberia, a position he held until his death in 1851. He worked to establish positive relations with neighboring nations and promote agriculture and trade.[1][2][3]

- Despite his pioneering accomplishments, Russwurm struggled with the dilemma of whether to stay and fight for change in the United States or emigrate to Africa, a common internal conflict for early Pan-Africanists.[1]

In summary, John Brown Russwurm was a trailblazing African American who made significant contributions as an abolitionist, journalist, and government leader in both the United States and Liberia in the early 19th century.[1][2][3][4][5]
