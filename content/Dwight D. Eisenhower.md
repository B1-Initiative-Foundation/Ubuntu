## Personal Life
Dwight D. Eisenhower was born on October 14, 1890 in Denison, Texas. He was the third of seven sons born to David Jacob Eisenhower and Ida Elizabeth Stover. The family later moved to Abilene, Kansas where Eisenhower grew up. [1][2] Eisenhower excelled in sports in high school, and received an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1911. [2] In 1916, he married Mamie Geneva Doud, with whom he had two sons - Doud Dwight, who died of scarlet fever in 1921, and John Sheldon Doud, born in 1922. [1]

## Career
Eisenhower had a long and distinguished military career. After graduating from West Point, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and served in various staff positions, including under Generals John J. Pershing, Douglas MacArthur, and Walter Krueger. [1][2] During World War II, Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe and led the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944. [1][2] After the war, he served as President of Columbia University and then as the first Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe. [2] 

In 1952, Eisenhower was elected the 34th President of the United States as a Republican. As president from 1953 to 1961, he pursued a moderate "Modern Republicanism" policy, continuing many New Deal and Fair Deal programs while emphasizing a balanced budget. [2] Key achievements included negotiating a truce in the Korean War, creating NASA, and overseeing the desegregation of the U.S. Armed Forces. [2]

## Achievements
Eisenhower's most significant achievements were his leadership during World War II as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, and his two terms as President of the United States. [1][2] As president, he oversaw the construction of the Interstate Highway System, signed the first major civil rights legislation since the Civil War, and helped ease Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union. [2] Eisenhower was named Gallup's most admired man of the year a record 12 times. [4]
