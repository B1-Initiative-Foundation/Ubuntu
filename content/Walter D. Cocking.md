## Summary
Walter D. Cocking was hired as the Dean of the College of Education at the University of [[Georgia]] in 1937 to improve academic standards. However, his efforts to reform the college and promote racial equality led to a major controversy known as the "Cocking Affair" in 1941. Despite support from the university community, Cocking was fired by the Georgia Board of Regents under pressure from Governor [[Eugene Talmadge]], who opposed Cocking's views on racial integration. The Cocking Affair had far-reaching consequences, leading to the dismissal of other educators and the loss of accreditation for the University of Georgia. Cocking's firing was seen as a major assault on higher education in Georgia and a victory for white supremacy. [1][2][3]

Walter D. Cocking was an academic administrator who served as the Dean of the College of Education at the University of Georgia from 1937 to 1941. He was fired, rehired, and then fired again for supporting racial integration during the Cocking affair.

## Personal Life
Walter D. Cocking was born in 1891 in Manchester, Iowa. He earned a bachelor's degree from Des Moines College, a master's degree from the University of Iowa, and a doctorate from Columbia University. [1]

## Career
Cocking held academic administrative positions in Iowa, Texas, and Missouri before serving as a professor of school administration at George Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville, Tennessee from 1933 to 1937. He then became the commissioner of education for Tennessee from 1933 to 1937. [1]

In 1937, Cocking was hired by the University of Georgia to improve the academic standards of the College of Education. He instituted several reforms, but his "brash and domineering style" offended some of his staff. [1][3]

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
In 1941, Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge insisted that Cocking be fired from the University of Georgia for supporting racial integration. After initially not rehiring Cocking, the university president threatened to resign unless Cocking received a fair hearing. Cocking was then rehired in an 8-7 vote, but Talmadge proceeded to fire and replace any Board of Regents members who opposed him. At the next meeting, Cocking was again fired in a 10-5 vote. [1][2][3]

The episode, known as the Cocking affair, sparked a storm of adverse publicity and led to the dismissal of 10 other outstanding educators in Georgia. The Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools investigated the political interference and voted unanimously to remove the University of Georgia's accreditation. [2][3]
