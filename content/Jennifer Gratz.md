In 1995, Jennifer Gratz applied for admission to the University of Michigan with a 3.8 GPA and 25 ACT score, but was denied admission. [1] Along with Patrick Hamacher, who was also denied admission to the University of Michigan in 1997 despite having a 3.0 GPA and 28 ACT score, Gratz filed a class-action lawsuit against the university in 1997 challenging its affirmative action admissions policies. [1][2] 

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in 2003 that the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, which awarded points based on an applicant's race, was unconstitutional. [1][2] This landmark civil rights case presented the Supreme Court with its most important decision on affirmative action in 25 years. [1]

Based on the search results, here is a concise and accurate response to the question:

Jennifer Gratz was a white applicant who was denied admission to the University of Michigan in 1995. She filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging that its use of racial preferences in undergraduate admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment[1][2][3]. 

Gratz's case, known as Gratz v. Bollinger, was consolidated with another affirmative action case, Grutter v. Bollinger, and heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003[2][4]. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, which automatically awarded 20 points (out of 150) to applicants from underrepresented minority groups, was unconstitutional[2][4]. 

The Court found that the university's point system did not provide for a sufficiently individualized consideration of each applicant, as required by the Court's previous ruling in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke[2][4]. This decision effectively ended the use of racial quotas and rigid point systems in college admissions.

Gratz's lawsuit was seen as a pivotal case in the growing campaign against affirmative action policies in higher education[1][3]. Her case was supported by conservative groups like the Center for Individual Rights, which had previously challenged affirmative action in other states[1][3].
