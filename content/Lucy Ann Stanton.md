Lucy Ann Stanton was the first African-American woman to graduate from college, earning a Literary Degree from Oberlin College in 1850.[1][2][3][4] She was born free in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] to Samuel and Margaret Stanton, and her stepfather was the abolitionist [[John Brown]].[2][3] Stanton attended Oberlin, a progressive abolitionist institution, and became president of the Oberlin Ladies Literary Society, delivering an anti-slavery commencement speech.[1][2][3][4] 

After graduating, Stanton taught in Columbus, Ohio, and later married fellow Oberlin graduate [[William Howard Day]], an abolitionist newspaper editor. In 1854, she became the first African-American woman to publish a fictional story, writing about slavery for her husband's newspaper.[1][2][3][4] The couple later moved to [[Buxton]], [[Canada]] to teach fugitive slaves, but Day abandoned the family in 1859.[2][3][4]

Stanton returned to Cleveland and worked as a seamstress, while remaining active as an abolitionist. In 1866, she was sponsored by the Cleveland Freedman's Association to teach in [[Georgia]] and [[Mississippi]], where she met and married her second husband, [[Levi Sessions]], in 1878.[2][3][4] The couple moved to [[Tennessee]], and in the 1880s and 1890s, Stanton was involved with the [[Women's Relief Corps]], [[Order of Eastern Star]], and [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]].[2][3][4] Stanton passed away in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1910.[2][3][4]

Lucy Ann Stanton was the first African American woman to complete a four-year college course of study, graduating from Oberlin College in 1850 with a Literary Degree.[1][2][4]

## Personal Life
Lucy Stanton was born free in Cleveland, Ohio on October 16, 1831. Her father, Samuel, was a free-born Black barber who died before Lucy was two years old. Her mother, Margaret, later remarried John Brown, a wealthy Black businessman and abolitionist who was active in the Underground Railroad. The family often harbored runaway slaves in their home.[1][4]

## Career
In 1846, Stanton enrolled at the Oberlin Collegiate Institute (now Oberlin College), a progressive abolitionist institution. In 1849, she was elected president of the school's Ladies Literary Society, and her commencement speech in 1850 was a moving appeal for antislavery.[1][3][4] 

After graduating, Stanton taught at a Black school in Columbus, Ohio. In 1852, she married her Oberlin classmate William Howard Day, a librarian who edited an abolitionist newspaper called the *Alienated American*. In 1854, Stanton became the first African American woman to have a fictional story published when she wrote a short story on slavery for her husband's newspaper.[1][2][4]

In 1856, the couple moved to Buxton, Canada to teach fugitive slaves. However, in 1859 William Day abandoned his family and moved to England. Stanton returned to Cleveland and worked as a seamstress, but remained active as an abolitionist.[1][4] 

In 1866, Stanton was sponsored by the Cleveland Freedmen's Association to teach in Georgia and later Mississippi, where she met and married her second husband, Levi Sessions, in 1878. The couple later moved to Tennessee, where Stanton continued her philanthropic work, including serving as president of the local Women's Christian Temperance Union.[1][4]

## Achievements

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions
There has been some dispute over whether Stanton or Mary Jane Patterson was the first African American woman to graduate from college, with some sources crediting Patterson instead. However, records show that Stanton graduated 12 years prior to Patterson, in 1850.[5]
