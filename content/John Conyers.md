Based on the search results, here is a concise answer to the question:

John Conyers was a Democratic representative for Michigan's 13th congressional district, serving from 2013 to 2017. He was previously the representative for Michigan's 14th congressional district from 1993 to 2012, and the representative for Michigan's 1st congressional district from 1965 to 1992.[1]

In 2017, Conyers resigned from office at the start of an investigation for sexual harassment, age discrimination, and improper use of official resources for personal purposes.[1] The House Committee on Ethics had opened an investigation into these allegations against Conyers in November 2017.[1]

Conyers was the primary sponsor of 30 bills that were enacted during his time in Congress, including the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2017.[1] However, he also had a high rate of missed votes, missing 16.9% of roll call votes from 1965 to 2017, which is much worse than the median of 2.5% among lifetime records of representatives serving in December 2017.[1]
