Paul Bertau Cornely was an American physician, public health pioneer, and civil rights activist. [1][2][3] In 1934, he became the first African American to earn a doctoral degree in public health. [1][2][3] He was elected President of the American Public Health Association in 1970. [1][3]

Cornely was born in [[Pointe-à-Pitre]], [[Guadeloupe]] in 1906. His family moved to [[Puerto Rico]] when he was 3 years old, and he later moved to the United States as a teenager, growing up mainly in [[Harlem]], [[New York]] and [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]. [1][2][3] He attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he earned his bachelor's, medical, and public health degrees. [1][2][3] 

At the University of Michigan, Cornely was one of only four Black students in a class of 250. [1][2] He was also a student during the Great Depression and worked to support himself throughout his studies. [1][2] After completing his internship at [[Lincoln Hospital]] in [[Durham]], [[North Carolina]], Cornely could not find a surgical residency program that would admit Black physicians, so he returned to the University of Michigan to complete a doctoral degree in public health. [1][2]

In 1934, Cornely joined the faculty of the [[Howard University College of Medicine]], where he developed a program that concentrated on public health provision to underserved communities. [1][2][3] He was the first Black person to be elected President of the American Public Health Association in 1970. [1][3] Cornely was an advocate for public health for all and argued that the government should provide healthcare to all citizens. [1][2]

Cornely was aware of the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment]] throughout its existence and taught it as a case study to African-American medical students at Howard University. [1][2] In later life, he described his failure to realize its ethical problems as a major mistake. [1][2]

Cornely retired from Howard University in 1973 as a Professor Emeritus of Community Health. [1][2] He died on February 9, 2002 in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]]. [2][3] The University of Michigan established the Cornely Postdoctoral Programme in his honor, which provides support to public health scholars "who are conducting research on the clarification, reduction, and elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities."[2]
