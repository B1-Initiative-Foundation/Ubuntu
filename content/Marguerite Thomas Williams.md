Marguerite Thomas Williams was the first Black individual of any gender to earn a doctorate degree in Geoscience in 1942 from the [[Catholic University of America]]. [1] Her dissertation was titled "A History of Erosion of the Anacostia Drainage Basin" which explored the factors leading to erosion in the Anacostia River, including natural erosion as well as human activities like deforestation, agriculture, and urbanization. [1]

Williams attended [[Howard University]] for her Bachelor's degree, while also teaching at a nearby elementary school. [1] After graduating in 1923, she became an assistant professor at [[Miner Teacher's College]], where she later became Chair of the College's Division of Geography in 1933 while also pursuing a Master's degree in geology which she completed in 1930. [1] 

After earning her Ph.D., Williams was promoted to a full professor position at Miner's, where she taught during the day and at [[Howard University]] by night, continuing to serve as an educator for minority students until her retirement in the 1950s. [1] Despite the limited information available, Williams is recognized for her pioneering work in opening the doors of geology to young Black students and pursuing higher education at a time when it was rarely seen for people of color. [1]

Marguerite Thomas Williams was the first African American (male or female) to earn a Ph.D. in geology in the United States.[1][2]

## Personal Life
Marguerite Thomas was born on December 24, 1895 in Washington, D.C. She was the last of six children born to Henry C. and Clara E. Thomas.[2] Thomas' interest in nature, geology, and geography began at a young age.[2]

After graduating from Columbia University, Marguerite Thomas married Otis James Williams, D.D.S. and took his surname.[2]

## Career
Marguerite Thomas Williams earned her bachelor's degree in geology from Howard University in 1923, where she was mentored by African American biologist Ernest Everett Just.[1][2] However, Just chose to award a position at Howard to Roger Arliner Young instead of Williams, despite Williams being better qualified.[1][2]

Williams taught at Miner Teacher's College (now the University of the District of Columbia) from 1923 to 1933, where she was chair of the Division of Geography.[1][2] She was allowed a leave of absence to pursue a master's degree at Columbia University, which she received in 1930.[1][2]

In 1942, Williams completed her Ph.D. dissertation titled "The Study of the History of Erosion in the Anacostia Drainage Basin" at the Catholic University of America, becoming the first African American to earn a doctorate in geology in the United States.[1][2] After earning her Ph.D., Williams was promoted to full professor at Miner.[2] She focused her career on teaching geography and social sciences, including night courses at Howard University, rather than research.[1][2] Williams retired in 1955.[2]

## Achievements
Marguerite Williams was a pioneer among geoscientists in recognizing how human activity and landscape management impact erosional processes.[2] Her research on fluvial sedimentology has impacted studies of fluvial sediments on Mars by the Mars Science Mission.[2] The Marguerite Microtunnel Boring Machine (MTBM) was also developed based on her contributions to geology.[2]

The American Geophysical Union presents the annual Marguerite T. Williams Award to mid-career scientists who have significantly advanced the field of Earth and space sciences.[2] The University College London Department of Earth Sciences also introduced a scholarship under Marguerite's name for students who have published works that invoke her legacy.[2]
