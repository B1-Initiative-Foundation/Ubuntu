Charles Henry Turner was an African-American entomologist, zoologist and early pioneer in the field of animal behavior. [1][2][3] He is best known for his work showing that social insects can modify their behavior as a result of experience. [1][3] 

Turner was born in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] in 1867. [1][2] He graduated as valedictorian from Gaines High School in 1886 and went on to earn a B.S. in Biology from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1891, followed by an M.S. in 1892. [1][2][5] In 1907, he earned a Ph.D. in Zoology from the [[University of Chicago]], becoming one of the first African Americans to earn a doctorate in the biological sciences. [1][2][3]

Despite his advanced degrees and over 70 scientific publications, Turner faced significant challenges in his career due to racism and lack of institutional support. [1][4] He held teaching positions at various schools, including [[Clark College]] in Atlanta and [[Sumner High School]] in St. Louis, where he remained until his retirement in 1922. [1][2][3]

Turner's research examined a wide range of topics, including avian brain structure, aquatic invertebrates, and the behavior of insects such as ants, bees, and cockroaches. [1][2][3] He is credited with developing novel experimental techniques and making important discoveries, such as the "Turner circling" behavior in ants. [1][3] 

In addition to his scientific work, Turner was a passionate advocate for civil rights and education. He served as a leader in the African American community in St. Louis and contributed articles on racial equality and education. [1][2]

Turner died in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1923 at the age of 56. [1][2] His groundbreaking contributions to the study of animal behavior and his perseverance in the face of significant obstacles have earned him recognition as a pioneering African-American scientist. [1][4]
